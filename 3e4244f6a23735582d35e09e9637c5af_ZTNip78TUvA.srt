8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,770
PROFESSOR: Today we
have plenty to do.

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:29,780
We really begin
in all generality

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,580
the addition of
angular momentum.

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,970
But we will do it in the set
up of a physical problem.

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,020
The problem of
computing the spin

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:46,960
orbit interactions of
electrons with the nucleus.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,940
So this is a rather interesting
and complicated interaction.

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,610
So we'll spend a
little time telling you

16
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,520
about the physics
of this interaction.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,230
And then once the
physics is clear,

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,720
it will become
more obvious why we

19
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,980
have to do these mathematical
contortions of adding angular

20
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,960
momentum in order to solve
this physical problem.

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,790
So it's a sophisticated problem
that requires several steps.

22
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,420
The first step is
something that is

23
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,480
a result in perturbation theory.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,460
Feynman Hellman Theorem
of perturbation theory.

25
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,270
And that's where we begin.

26
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,770
So it's called Feynman
Hellman Theorem.

27
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:41,900
It's a very simple result.

28
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:47,105
Theorem.

29
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,530
And we'll need it in
order to understand

30
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,990
how a small perturbation
to the Hamiltonian

31
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,240
changes the energy spectrum.

32
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:12,110
So we have H of lambda be a
Hamiltonian with a parameter

33
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,252
in lambda.

34
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,540
Lambda.

35
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:30,640
And psi n of lambda
being normalized energy

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:40,550
eigenstate with
energy, En of lambda.

37
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,890
So that's the whole
assumption of the theorem.

38
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,130
We have a Hamiltonian.

39
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,080
It depends on some parameter
that we're going to vary.

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,530
And suppose we consider now an
eigenstate of this Hamiltonian

41
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,140
that depends on lambda,
so the eigenstate also

42
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,050
depends on lambda.

43
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,770
And it has an
energy, En of lambda.

44
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,860
So the purpose of
this theorem is

45
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,130
to relate these
various quantities.

46
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:22,530
And the claim is that
the rate of change

47
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,810
of the energy with
respect to lambda

48
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:34,900
can be computed pretty much by
evaluating the rate of change

49
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,140
of the Hamiltonian on
the relevant states.

50
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,660
So that's the claim.

51
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,740
And it's a pretty nice result.

52
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,940
It's useful in
many circumstances.

53
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,630
And for us will be a way to
discuss a little perturbation

54
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,470
theory.

55
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,240
Perturbation theory is the
subject of 806 in all details.

56
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,970
And it's a very
sophisticated subject.

57
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,970
Even today we were going
to be finding that it's not

58
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,140
all that easy to carry it out.

59
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,100
So how does this begin?

60
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,890
Well, proof.

61
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,410
You begin by saying
that En of lambda

62
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,860
is the energy eigenstate,
is nothing else

63
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,200
but psi n of lambda.

64
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,950
H of lambda.

65
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,810
Psi n of lambda.

66
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:01,860
And the reason is, of
course, that H and psi n

67
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,400
is En of lambda times
psi n of lambda.

68
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,385
And this is a number goes out.

69
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:12,400
And the inner product
of this things

70
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,140
is 1, because the
state is normalized.

71
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,980
So this is a good
starting point.

72
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:24,780
And the funny thing that you see
already is that, in some sense,

73
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,840
you just get the
middle term when

74
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,290
you take the derivative
with respect to lambda.

75
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,320
You don't get anything
from these two.

76
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,540
And it's simple in fact.

77
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,310
So let me just do it.

78
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,880
V, En, V lambda
would be the term

79
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,140
that Feynman and Hellman gave.

80
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:55,400
V, H, V lambda, psi n of lambda.

81
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,470
Plus one term in which we
differentiate this one.

82
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:05,500
V, d lambda of the
state psi n of lambda.

83
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:17,130
Times H of lambda,
psi n of lambda.

84
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,380
Plus the other term in which
you differentiate the ket.

85
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:32,610
So psi n of lambda, H of lambda,
d, d lambda of psi n of lambda.

86
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:46,710
And the reason these
terms are going to vanish

87
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:53,020
is that you can now act
with H again on psi n.

88
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,620
H is supposed to be Hermitian,
so it can act on the left.

89
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:07,220
And therefore, these two
terms give you En of lambda,

90
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:19,400
times d d lambda of psi n of
lambda-- psi n of lambda--

91
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,750
plus the other term, which
would be psi n of lambda,

92
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,395
the bra times the
derivative of the ket.

93
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:43,550
But this is nothing
else than the derivative

94
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,730
of the inner product.

95
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,250
In the inner product
to differentiate--

96
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,020
the inner product
differentiates the bra,

97
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,920
it differentiates the ket.

98
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,280
And do it.

99
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,220
And this thing is equal to
1, because it's normalized.

100
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,890
So this is 0.

101
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,650
End of proof.

102
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,320
These two terms vanish.

103
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,860
And the result holds.

104
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,652
Yes?

105
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:23,527
AUDIENCE: How do you
know it stays normalized

106
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:24,505
when you vary lambda?

107
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:28,440
PROFESSOR: It's an assumption.

108
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,770
The state is normalized
for all values of n.

109
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,925
So if you have a state
that you've constructed,

110
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:39,669
that is normalized, you
can have this result.

111
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,030
So it's an assumption.

112
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,845
You have to keep the
state normalized.

113
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,900
Now this is a baby version
of perturbation theory.

114
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,320
It's a result I think that
Feynman did as an undergrad.

115
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,290
And as you can see,
it's very simple.

116
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,290
Calling it a theorem
is a little too much.

117
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,540
But still, the fact
is that it's useful.

118
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,670
And so we'll just
go ahead and use it.

119
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,910
Now I want to rewrite
it in another way.

120
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,250
So, suppose you have
a Hamiltonian, H,

121
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:24,755
which has a term
H0, plus lambda, H1.

122
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:41,770
So, the parameter lambda, H of
lambda, is given in this way.

123
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,180
And that's a
reasonable H of lambda.

124
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,860
Sometimes, this could be
written as H0 plus something

125
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,670
that we will call the
change in the Hamiltonian.

126
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:57,540
And we usually think
of it as a small thing.

127
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,190
So what do we have
from this theorem?

128
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:18,020
From this here we would
have the d, En, d lambda

129
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:29,380
is equal to psi n of
lambda, H1, psi n of lambda.

130
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,400
Now, we can be
particularly interested

131
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,250
in the evaluation of this
thing at lambda equals 0.

132
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,830
So what is d En of lambda?

133
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:55,330
d lambda at lambda equals
0 would be psi n at zero,

134
00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:00,970
H1, psi n at 0.

135
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:07,870
And therefore, you would say
that the En of lambda energies

136
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:19,790
would be the energies
at 0, plus lambda, d En

137
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:25,510
of lambda, d lambda
at lambda equals 0,

138
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,093
plus order lambda squared.

139
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,740
I'm doing just the
Taylor expansion

140
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:46,450
of En's of lambda
from lambda equals 0.

141
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:56,480
So this thing tells you that
En of lambda is equal En of 0,

142
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:08,302
plus-- this derivative you can
write it as psi n, lambda, H1,

143
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:13,008
psi n, all at 0.

144
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:13,980
Like that.

145
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,955
Plus order lambda squared.

146
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:28,600
So in this step, I just use the
evaluation that we did here.

147
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,380
I substituted that
and put the lambda in.

148
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:45,470
So that I recognize now that En
of lambda is equal to En of 0,

149
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:53,990
plus psi n of 0-- and I can
write this as delta H-- psi

150
00:12:53,990 --> 00:13:00,803
n of 0, plus order
delta H squared.

151
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,780
It's nice to write it this
way, because you appreciate

152
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,540
more the power of the theorem.

153
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,640
The theorem here doesn't assume
which value of lambda you have.

154
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,070
And you have to have
normalized eigenstates.

155
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,320
And you wonder what is
it helping you with,

156
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,820
if finding the states for every
value of lambda is complicated.

157
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:37,160
Well, it certainly
helps you to figure out

158
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,960
how the energy of the state
varies by a simple calculation.

159
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,725
Suppose you know the states
of the simple Hamiltonian.

160
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:55,630
Those are the psi's, n, 0.

161
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,870
So if you have the
psi n 0 over here,

162
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,120
you can do the following step.

163
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,930
If you want to figure out
how it's energy has varied,

164
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:14,260
use this formula in which
you compute the expectation

165
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:20,370
value of the change in the
Hamiltonian on that state.

166
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:26,310
And that is the first correction
to the energy of the state.

167
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,010
So you have this state.

168
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,710
You compute the
expectation value

169
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,880
of the extra piece
in the Hamiltonian.

170
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,270
And that's the
correction to the energy.

171
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,300
It's a little more
complicated of course

172
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,600
to compute the
correction to the state.

173
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,570
But that's a subject
of perturbation theory.

174
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,790
And that's not what we
care about right now.

175
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:57,410
So the reason we're doing this
is because actually whatever

176
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,010
we're going to have
with spin orbit coupling

177
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,100
represents an addition
to the hydrogen

178
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,680
Hamiltonian of a new term.

179
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,060
Therefore, you want to know what
happens to the energy levels.

180
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,970
And the best thing
to think about them

181
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,360
is to-- if you know the
energy levels of this one,

182
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,980
well, a formula of
this type can let

183
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,082
you know what happens
to the energy levels

184
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:21,040
after the perturbation.

185
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,790
There will be an
extra complication

186
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,500
in that the energy levels
that we're going to deal with

187
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,930
are going to be degenerate.

188
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,980
But let's wait for that
complication until it appears.

189
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,650
So any questions?

190
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,870
Yes?

191
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,820
AUDIENCE: So I would
imagine that this

192
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,704
would work just
as well for time.

193
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:45,974
Because time [INAUDIBLE] a
parameter in quantum mechanics.

194
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:48,404
So [INAUDIBLE]

195
00:15:48,404 --> 00:15:50,830
PROFESSOR: Time dependent
perturbation theory

196
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,930
is a bit more complicated.

197
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,860
I'd rather not get into it now.

198
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,450
So let's leave it here, in
which we don't have time.

199
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,280
And the Schrodinger
equation is something

200
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,617
like H psi equal [INAUDIBLE]
psi, that's all we care.

201
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:11,250
And leave it for that moment.

202
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:11,933
Other questions?

203
00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:22,460
OK.

204
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:28,530
So let's proceed with
addition of angular momentum.

205
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:34,160
So first, let me give you
the fundamental result

206
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,010
of addition of angular momentum.

207
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,880
It's a little abstract,
but it's what we really

208
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,725
mean by addition of
angular momentum.

209
00:16:45,197 --> 00:16:48,763
Of angular momentum.

210
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,960
And the main result
is the following.

211
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:00,450
Suppose you have a set
of operators, J, i,

212
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,929
1, that have the algebra
of angular momentum.

213
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,250
Of angular momentum.

214
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:21,609
Which is to say
Ji1, JJ1, is equal

215
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:25,712
i, h bar, epsilon iJK, JK1.

216
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,180
And this algebra is realized
on some state space.

217
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:41,330
On some vector space, V1.

218
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,760
And suppose you have
another operator,

219
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,180
J-- set of operators actually.

220
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,395
Ji2, which have the algebra
of angular momentum.

221
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:53,470
I will not write that.

222
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,280
On some V2.

223
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,640
OK.

224
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,340
Angular momentum,
some sets of states.

225
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,570
Angular momentum on some
other set of states.

226
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,090
Here comes the thing.

227
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,620
There is a new angular
momentum, which

228
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:24,970
is the sum Ji defined
as Ji1, added with Ji2.

229
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:30,560
Now, soon enough you will
just write Ji1, plus Ji2.

230
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,590
But let me be a little
more careful now.

231
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:45,290
This sum is Ji1,
plus 1, tensor Ji2.

232
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,080
So i is the same index.

233
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,230
But here, we're
having this operator

234
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,140
that we're being defined
that we call it the sum.

235
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,730
Now how do you sum two operators
that act in different spaces?

236
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,680
Well, the only thing
that you can actually do

237
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,120
is sum them in the
tensor product.

238
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:19,136
So the claim is that this is an
angular momentum in V1 tensor

239
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:19,635
V2.

240
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,190
That is an operator.

241
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,690
You see, you have to sum them.

242
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:34,490
So you have to create a
space where both can act,

243
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,180
and you can sum them.

244
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,320
You cannot sum a thing, an
operator that acts on one

245
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,420
vector space to an operator that
acts on another vector space.

246
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,850
You have to create one
vector space where both act.

247
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,250
And then you can define
the sum of the operators.

248
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,750
Sum of operators
is a simple thing.

249
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,460
So you form the tensor product.

250
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,680
In here, this
operator gets upgraded

251
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,390
in this way, in which in the
tensor product it has a 1

252
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,970
for the second input.

253
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,290
This one gets
upgrade to this way.

254
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,250
And this is the sum.

255
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,270
So this is a claim--
this is a definition.

256
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,640
And this is a claim.

257
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,430
So this has to be proven.

258
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,370
So let me prove it.

259
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,910
Ji, JJ.

260
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,730
I compute this commutator.

261
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,930
So I don't have to
do the following.

262
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:45,530
I have to do Ji1, tensor
1, plus 1 tensor Ji2.

263
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:56,620
And then the JJ would be JJ1,
tensor 1, plus 1, tensor JJ2.

264
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,320
Have to compute this commutator.

265
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,880
Now, an important
fact about this

266
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,320
result that I'm not
trying to generalize,

267
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,700
if you had put a minus
here, it wouldn't work out.

268
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,480
If you would have put a 2
here, it wouldn't work out.

269
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,130
If you would have put a 1/2
here, it won't work out.

270
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,060
This is pretty much
the only way you

271
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,370
can have two angular momenta,
and create a third angular

272
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,620
momentum.

273
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,240
So look at this.

274
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,820
It looks like we're going
to have to work hard,

275
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,490
but that's not true.

276
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,650
Consider this commutator.

277
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,970
The commutator of this
term with this term.

278
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,430
That's 0 actually.

279
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:51,950
Because if you multiply them
in this order, this times that,

280
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:57,080
you get Ji1 times Ji2,
because the ones do nothing.

281
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,710
You multiply them in
the reverse order,

282
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,860
you get again, Ji1 times Ji2.

283
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,895
This is to say that the
operators that originally lived

284
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:13,510
in the different
vector spaces commute.

285
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,260
Yes?

286
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,320
AUDIENCE: Since the cross
terms between those two

287
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,900
are 0-- like you just said,
the cross terms are 0.

288
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,600
And if you put a minus sign
in there, it will cancel.

289
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,494
But when you do
the multiplications

290
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:33,318
with the second ones, why can't
you put a minus sign in there?

291
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:34,170
[INAUDIBLE]

292
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,420
PROFESSOR: In the whole thing?

293
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,790
In this definition,
a minus sign?

294
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,720
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

295
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,900
PROFESSOR: Well, here
if I put a minus--

296
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,270
it's like I'm going to
prove that this works.

297
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,860
So if-- I'm going to
get an angular momentum.

298
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,750
If I put a minus sign
to angular momentum,

299
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,420
I ruin the algebra here.

300
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,810
I put a minus minus, it cancels.

301
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,010
But then I get a
minus sign here.

302
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,940
So I cannot really
even change a sign.

303
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:09,690
So any way, these are operators
acting on different spaces.

304
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,320
They commute.

305
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,375
It's clear they commute.

306
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,700
You just multiply
them, and see that.

307
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,860
These one's commute as well.

308
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:23,730
The only ones that don't
commute are this with this.

309
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,310
And that with that.

310
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,520
So let me just write them.

311
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:38,430
Ji1, tensor 1,
with JJ1, tensor 1.

312
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:50,347
Plus this one, 1 tensor
Ji2, 1 tensor JJ2.

313
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,870
OK, next step is to
realize that actually

314
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:07,280
the 1 is a spectator here.

315
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,180
Therefore, this
commutator is nothing

316
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:19,130
but the commutator Ji1
with JJ1, tensor 1.

317
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,510
You can do it.

318
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,530
If you prefer to
write it, write it.

319
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:32,930
This product is Ji
times JJ, tensor 1.

320
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,240
And the other product
is JJ, Ji, tensor 1.

321
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,040
So the tensor 1 factors out.

322
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,980
Here the tensor 1
also factors out.

323
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:50,470
And you get an honest
commutator, Ji2, JJ2.

324
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,290
So one last step.

325
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,920
This is i, h bar, epsilon, iJK.

326
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,750
I'll put a big parentheses.

327
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:12,990
JK1, tensor 1,
for the first one.

328
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,530
Because J1 forms an
angular momentum algebra.

329
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,750
And here, 1 tensor JK2.

330
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:36,280
And this thing is i,
h bar, epsilon, iJK.

331
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,880
The total angular
momentum, K. And you've

332
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,990
shown the algebra works out.

333
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,620
Now most people after
a little practice,

334
00:25:52,620 --> 00:26:02,890
they just say, oh, Ji is
J1 plus J2, J1 plus J2.

335
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,910
J1 and J2 don't commute.

336
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,870
J2 and J1-- I'm sorry.

337
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,390
J1 and J2 commute.

338
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,110
J2 and J1 commute.

339
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:14,470
Therefore you get
this 2, like that.

340
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:18,760
And this gives you--
J1 and J1 gives you J1.

341
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,230
J2 and J2 gives you J2,
so the sum works out.

342
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,530
So most people after
a little practice

343
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,100
just don't put all
these tensor things.

344
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,320
But at the beginning it's
nice to just make sure

345
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,700
that you understand what
these tensor things do.

346
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,280
All right.

347
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,700
So that's our main
theorem-- that you

348
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,180
start with one angular
momentum on a state space.

349
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,090
Another angular momentum that
has nothing to do perhaps

350
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:53,170
with the first on
another vector space.

351
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:58,390
And on the tensor product you
have another angular momentum,

352
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,420
which is the sum.

353
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,670
All right.

354
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,590
So now, we do spin
orbit coupling

355
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,660
to try to apply these ideas.

356
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:25,060
So for spin orbit coupling, we
will consider the hydrogen atom

357
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,000
coupling.

358
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,610
And the new term in the
Hamiltonian, mu dot B.

359
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:41,390
The kind of term that we've
done so much in this semester.

360
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,880
We've looked over magnetic ones.

361
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,700
So which magnetic
moment at which B?

362
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,050
There was no B in
the hydrogen atom.

363
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:54,850
Well, there's no
B to begin with.

364
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:58,980
But here is one where you can
think there is a B. First,

365
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:06,280
this will be the
electron dipole moment.

366
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,790
Magnetic dipole moment.

367
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,350
So we have a formula for it.

368
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:17,370
The formula for it is the mu of
the electron is minus E over m,

369
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,960
times the spin of the electron.

370
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,090
And I actually will use a
little different formula

371
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:28,130
that is valued in
Gaussian units.

372
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:35,550
ge over mC, S, in
Gaussian units.

373
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:42,070
And g is the g factor of
the electron, which is 2.

374
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,770
I'm sorry.

375
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,850
There's a 2 here.

376
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:45,440
OK.

377
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,990
So look what I've written.

378
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,540
I don't want to distract
you with this too much.

379
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:53,270
But you know that the magnetic
dipole of the electron

380
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,310
is given by this quantity.

381
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,930
Now, you could put a
2 up, and a 2 down.

382
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:02,120
And that's why people
actually classically

383
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,410
there seems to be a 2 down.

384
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:08,220
But there's a 2 up, because
it's an effect of the electron.

385
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,640
And you have this formula.

386
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,650
The only thing I've
added in that formula

387
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,390
is a factor of C that is
because of Gaussian units.

388
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,250
And it allows you to estimate
terms a little more easily.

389
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,610
So that's the mu
of the electron.

390
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:28,600
But the electron apparently
would feel no magnetic field.

391
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,320
You didn't put an
external magnetic field.

392
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:37,070
Except that here
you go in this way

393
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,840
of thinking-- you think
suppose you are the electron.

394
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,340
You see a proton, which is
a nucleus going around you.

395
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,750
And a proton going around you
is a current going around you.

396
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,280
It generates a magnetic field.

397
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,840
And therefore, you
see a magnetic field

398
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,260
created by the proton
going around you.

399
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,400
So there is a magnetic field.

400
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,720
And there's a magnetic
field experienced

401
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,440
by the electron--
felt by electron.

402
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:19,570
So you can think of
this, the electron.

403
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,100
Here is the proton
with the plus charge,

404
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,190
and here's the electron.

405
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:29,060
And the electron is
going around the proton.

406
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,730
Now, from the viewpoint
of the electron,

407
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,690
the proton is going around him.

408
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,000
So here is the proton.

409
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,330
Here is the electron
going like that.

410
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,040
From the viewpoint
of the electron,

411
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,760
the proton is going like this.

412
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,350
Also, from the viewpoint
of the electron,

413
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,335
the proton would be
going in this direction

414
00:30:51,335 --> 00:30:54,150
and creating a
magnetic field up.

415
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:06,570
And the magnetic field
up corresponds actually

416
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:11,775
to the idea that the angular
momentum of the electron

417
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:16,970
is also up-- L of the
electron is also up.

418
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:20,870
So the whole point
of this thing is

419
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:25,670
that somehow this magnetic field
is proportional to the angular

420
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,100
momentum.

421
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,900
And then, L will come here.

422
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,770
And here, you have
S. So you have

423
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:39,440
L dot S. That's the
fine structure coupling.

424
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:45,300
Now let me do a little
of this so that we just

425
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,080
get a bit more feeling,
although it's unfortunately

426
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,000
a somewhat frustrating exercise.

427
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,790
So let me tell you
what's going on.

428
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,836
So consider the electron.

429
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:05,600
At some point, look at
it and draw a plane.

430
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,000
So the electron-- let's
assume it's going down.

431
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,090
Here is the proton.

432
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,670
It's going around in circles.

433
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,660
So here, it's going down.

434
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,280
The electron is going down.

435
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,900
Electron, its velocity of
the electron is going down.

436
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,380
The proton is over here.

437
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,740
And the electron is
going around like that.

438
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,350
The proton would produce an
electric field of this form.

439
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:42,080
Now, in relativity, the
electric and magnetic fields

440
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,920
seen by different
observers are different.

441
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,210
So there is this electric
field that we see.

442
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:52,260
We sit here, and we
see in our rest frame

443
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,330
this proton creates
an electric field.

444
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:00,760
And then, from the
viewpoint of the electron,

445
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,280
the electron is moving.

446
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,840
And there is an electric field.

447
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,020
But whenever you are moving
inside an electric field,

448
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,560
you also see a magnetic field
generated by the motion,

449
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,910
by relativistic effects.

450
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:20,010
The magnetic field
that you see is roughly

451
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:27,560
given to first order in
relativity by V cross E over c.

452
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:37,120
So V cross E, VE
V cross E over c

453
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,900
up-- change sign
because of this.

454
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,740
And the magnetic
field consistently,

455
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,860
as we would expect,
goes in this direction.

456
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,210
So it's consistent
with the picture

457
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,840
that we developed that if you
were the electron, the proton,

458
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,940
would be going around
in circles like that

459
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,790
and the magnetic
field would be up.

460
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:07,730
Now here I can change the sign
by doing E cross V over c.

461
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:11,783
So this is the magnetic
field seen by the electron.

462
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:30,010
OK, so we need a little more
work on that magnetic field

463
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:33,610
by calculating the
electric field.

464
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,219
Now, what is the electric field?

465
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:39,865
Well, the scalar potential
for the hydrogen atom,

466
00:34:39,865 --> 00:34:44,670
we write it as minus
e squared over r.

467
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,159
It's actually not quite
the scalar potential.

468
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,980
But it is the potential energy.

469
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:55,440
It has one factor of e more than
what the scalar potential is.

470
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,940
Remember, the scalar
potential in electromagnetism

471
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,260
is charge divided by r.

472
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,000
So it has one factor of e more.

473
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,100
What is the derivative
of this potential?

474
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:12,370
With respect to r, it's
e squared over r squared.

475
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:16,990
So the electric field goes
like e over r squared.

476
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:29,410
So the electric field is
equal to dV dr divided by e.

477
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,500
That's the magnitude
of the electric field.

478
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:40,150
And its direction is radial from
the viewpoint of the proton.

479
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,935
The electric field is here.

480
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:51,920
So this can be written
as r vector divided by r.

481
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:07,000
Therefore, the magnetic field
will-- [INAUDIBLE] this.

482
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,320
The magnetic field
now can be calculated.

483
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,400
And we'll see what
we claimed was

484
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,930
the relation with
angular momentum.

485
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:25,850
Because B prime
is now E cross V.

486
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:37,170
So you have 1 over
ec 1 over r dV dr.

487
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,960
I've taken care of this.

488
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,770
And now I just have
r cross V. Well,

489
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:51,240
r cross V is your angular
momentum if you had p here.

490
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,970
So we borrow a factor of
the mass of the electron,

491
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:06,570
ecm 1 over r dV dr
L, L of the electron.

492
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:16,380
p equals mv.

493
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:22,180
So we have a nice formula
for B. And then, we

494
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:28,460
can go and calculate delta
H. Delta H would then

495
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:45,380
be minus mu dot B. And that
would be ge over 2mc spin

496
00:37:45,380 --> 00:38:01,670
dot L-- mu was given here--
S dot L 1 over r dV dr.

497
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:07,150
And that is the split
spin orbit interaction.

498
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:10,150
Now, the downside
of this derivation

499
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,015
is that it has a
relativistic error.

500
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,370
There's a phenomenon
called Thomas precession

501
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:23,870
that affects this result.

502
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:26,330
We didn't waste our time.

503
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:32,250
The true result is that you
must subtract from this g 1.

504
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:37,730
So g must really be
replaced by g minus 1.

505
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:41,040
Since g is approximately
2 for the electron,

506
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,080
the true result is
really 1/2 of this thing.

507
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,760
So this should not
be in parentheses,

508
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,200
but true result is this.

509
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:59,770
And the mistake that is done
in calculating this spin orbit

510
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:04,970
coupling is that this
spin orbit coupling

511
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:08,510
affects precession rates.

512
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:12,260
All these interactions
of magnetic dipoles

513
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,540
with magnetic fields
affect precession rates.

514
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,020
And you have to be a
little more careful here

515
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:24,200
that the system where you've
worked, the electron rest frame

516
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,370
is not quite an inertial system.

517
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:29,330
Because it's doing
circular motion.

518
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:33,420
So there's an extra correction
that has to be done.

519
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,350
Thomas precession or Thomas
correction it's called.

520
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:41,170
And it would be a
detour of about one hour

521
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,900
in special relativity
to do it right.

522
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,676
So Griffiths doesn't do it.

523
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:51,010
I don't think Shankar does it.

524
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,280
Pretty much graduate
books do it.

525
00:39:56,088 --> 00:39:59,990
So we will not try to do better.

526
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:02,550
I mentioned that
fact that this really

527
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,260
should be reduced to
one half of its value.

528
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,780
And it's an interesting
system to analyze.

529
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:15,170
So Thomas precession is
that relativistic correction

530
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:18,540
to precession rates when the
object that is precessing

531
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,820
is in an accelerated frame.

532
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,670
And any rotating
frame is accelerated.

533
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:31,200
So this result needs correction.

534
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,450
OK, but let's take this result
as it is-- instead of g,

535
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,640
g minus 1.

536
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,810
Let's not worry
too much about it.

537
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:44,686
And let's just estimate
how big this effect is.

538
00:40:44,686 --> 00:40:50,470
It's the last thing I want
to do as a way of motivating

539
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,460
this subject.

540
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,850
So delta H is this.

541
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,770
Let's estimate it.

542
00:40:55,770 --> 00:41:03,090
Now for estimates, a couple of
things are useful to remember,

543
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:08,640
that Bohr radius is h
squared over me squared.

544
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,740
We did that last time.

545
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,680
And there's this constant
that is very useful,

546
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,620
the fine structure constant,
which is e squared over hc.

547
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,885
And it's about 1 over 137.

548
00:41:21,885 --> 00:41:27,090
And it helps you estimate
all kinds of things.

549
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:31,580
Because it's a rather
complicated number to evaluate,

550
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:36,450
you need all kinds of
units and things like that.

551
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:43,180
So the charge of the electron
divided by hc being 1 over 137

552
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,680
is quite nice.

553
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:53,050
So let's estimate
delta H. Well, g

554
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:58,160
we won't worry-- 2,
1, doesn't matter.

555
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:07,530
e mc-- so far, that
is kind of simple.

556
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:13,036
Then we have S dot L. Well,
how do I estimate S dot L?

557
00:42:13,036 --> 00:42:15,740
I don't do too much.

558
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,850
S spin is multiples of h bar.

559
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:23,960
L for an atomic state will be
1, 2, 3, so multiples of h bar.

560
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,430
So h bar squared,
that's it for S dot L.

561
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:33,500
1 over r is 1 over r.

562
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,570
dV dr is e squared
over r squared.

563
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,280
And that's it.

564
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,760
But here, instead of r, I
should put the typical length

565
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,950
of the hydrogen
atom, which is a0.

566
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,210
So what do I get?

567
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:57,300
I'm sorry, I made
a mistake here.

568
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,407
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's up there.

569
00:42:59,407 --> 00:43:03,079
PROFESSOR: Oh, I
made a mistake here

570
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:09,910
in that I didn't put
this factor, 1 over ecm.

571
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,980
So the e cancels.

572
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,920
And this is the result
here-- g over 2m

573
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:39,900
squared c squared S dot L 1 over
r dV dr. So let me start again.

574
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:49,680
1 over m squared c squared h
bar squared 1 over r dV dr--

575
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,550
that much I got right.

576
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:58,810
So this is roughly
1 over [INAUDIBLE]

577
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:02,220
of the electron
squared c squared e

578
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:08,780
squared over a0 cubed
h squared-- still quite

579
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,610
messy, but not that terrible.

580
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:16,700
So in order to get an
idea of how big this is,

581
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,720
the ground state energy
of the hydrogen atom

582
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,400
was e squared over 2a0.

583
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:30,610
So let's divide delta H over
the ground state energy.

584
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,220
And that's how much?

585
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:37,850
Well, we have all this
quantity, 1 over m

586
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:44,490
squared c squared e
squared a0 cubed h squared.

587
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:53,110
And now, we must divide by
e squared over a0 like this.

588
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,370
Well, the e squareds cancel.

589
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:11,800
And we get h squared over m
squared c squared a0 squared.

590
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,950
You need to know what a0 is.

591
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:16,640
Let's just boil it down
to the simplest thing,

592
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,760
so h squared m
squared c squared.

593
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:26,120
a0 squared would be h to
the fourth m squared e

594
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,540
to the fourth.

595
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:33,840
So this is actually e
to the fourth over h

596
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:41,200
squared c squared, or e squared
over hc squared, which is alpha

597
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:41,700
squared.

598
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,510
Whew-- lots of work to
get something very nice.

599
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:56,910
The ratio of the spin orbit
coupling to the ground state

600
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,850
energy is 1 over alpha squared.

601
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:05,310
It's alpha squared, which
is 1 over 137 squared.

602
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:08,040
So it's a pretty small thing.

603
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:14,250
It's about 1 over 19,000.

604
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:19,850
So when this is called fine
structure of the hydrogen atom,

605
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:24,300
it means that it's in
the level in your page

606
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:30,040
that you use a few inches
to plot the 13.6 electron

607
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:35,450
volts-- well, you're talking
about 20,000 times smaller,

608
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:38,820
something that you don't see.

609
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,410
But of course, it's a
pretty important thing.

610
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:48,960
So all in all, in the
conventions of-- this

611
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,900
is done in Gaussian units.

612
00:46:53,900 --> 00:47:01,140
In SI units, which is
what Griffiths uses,

613
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:08,560
delta H is e squared over
8 pi epsilon 0 1 over m

614
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:17,450
squared c squared r cubed S
dot L. That's for reference.

615
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:18,275
This is Griffiths.

616
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,310
But this is correct as well.

617
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:27,440
This is the correct value.

618
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,960
This is the correct
value already taking

619
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,340
into account the
relativistic correction.

620
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:37,270
So here, you're supposed
to let g go to g minus 1.

621
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:42,490
So you can put the 1 there,
and it's pretty accurate.

622
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:45,590
All right, so what is
the physics question

623
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:49,500
we want to answer with
this spin orbit coupling?

624
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:54,640
So here it comes.

625
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,920
You have the hydrogen
atom spectrum.

626
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,460
And that spectrum you know.

627
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:05,050
At L equals 0, you
have one state here.

628
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:09,890
Then, that's n
equals 1, n equals 2.

629
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:16,580
You have one state here and
one state here at L equals 1.

630
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:21,260
Then n equals 3, they start
getting very close together.

631
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:25,980
n equals 4 is like that.

632
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:31,370
Let's consider if you want
to have spin orbit coupling,

633
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:35,880
we must have angular momentum.

634
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:42,330
And that's L. And therefore,
let's consider this state here.

635
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:47,420
l equals 1, n equals 1--
n equals 2, I'm sorry.

636
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:56,520
What happens to those
states, is the question.

637
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,110
First, how many states
do you have there

638
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:02,120
and how should
you think of them?

639
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,430
Well actually, we know that
an l equals 1 corresponds

640
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:07,970
to three states.

641
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:13,820
So you'd have lm
with l equals 1.

642
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:18,310
And then m can be
1, 0, or minus 1.

643
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:20,730
So you have three states.

644
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:23,840
But there's not
really three states.

645
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,420
Because the electron
can have spin.

646
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:31,770
So here it is, a tensor product
that appears in your face

647
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:36,150
because there is
more than angular

648
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:37,430
momentum to the electron.

649
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:38,630
There's spin.

650
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:42,130
And it's a totally different
vector space, the same particle

651
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:45,780
but another vector
space, the spin space.

652
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:50,140
So here, you have the possible
spins of the electron.

653
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,130
So that's another
angular momentum.

654
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:57,525
And well, you could have the
plus/minus states, for example.

655
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:05,290
So you have three states
here and two states here.

656
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:16,440
So this is really six
states, so six states

657
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,700
whose fate we would
like to understand

658
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,355
due to this spin orbit coupling.

659
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:35,610
So to use the language
of angular momentum,

660
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:37,740
instead of writing
plus/minus, you

661
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:49,990
could write Smz, if you will--
ms I will call, spin of s.

662
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:59,780
You have here spin of 1/2
and states 1/2 or minus 1/2.

663
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,040
This is the up.

664
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:07,040
When the z component of the spin
that we always call m-- m now

665
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,760
corresponds to the z
component of angular momentum.

666
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,846
So in general, even
for spin, we use m.

667
00:51:12,846 --> 00:51:16,410
And we have that our two
spin states of the electron

668
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:21,880
are spin 1/2 particle with
plus spin in the z direction,

669
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:26,550
spin 1/2 particle with minus
spin in the z direction.

670
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,380
We usually never
put this 1/2 here.

671
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,700
But now you have here
really three states--

672
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:39,950
1, 1, 1, 0, 1, minus 1,
the first telling you

673
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:42,810
about the total
angular momentum.

674
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:45,480
Here, the total spin is 1/2.

675
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,860
But it happens to be
either up or down.

676
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,550
Here, the total
angular momentum is 1.

677
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:56,010
But it happens to be plus
1, 0, or minus 1 here.

678
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:58,830
So these are our six states.

679
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:01,600
You can combine this with this,
this with that, this with this,

680
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,320
this with that.

681
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,870
You make all the products.

682
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,610
And these are the six
states of the hydrogen

683
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:08,090
atom at this level.

684
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:13,100
And we wish to know
what happens to them.

685
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:17,910
Now, this correction is small.

686
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:22,750
So it fits our understanding
of the perturbation theory

687
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,310
of Feynman-Hellman
in which we try

688
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:29,660
to find the corrections
to these things.

689
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:35,130
Our difficulty now is a
little serious, however.

690
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:37,290
It's the fact that
Feynman-Hellman

691
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:39,870
assumed that you had a state.

692
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:43,600
And it was an eigenstate of
the corrected Hamiltonian

693
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,930
as you moved along.

694
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:51,220
And then, you could compute
how its energy changes.

695
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:56,260
Here, unfortunately, we have a
much more difficult situation.

696
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:59,580
These six states that
I'm not listing yet,

697
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:07,170
but I will list very soon,
are not obviously eigenstates

698
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:12,340
of delta H. In fact, they are
not eigenstates of delta H.

699
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:15,790
They're degenerate states,
six degenerate states,

700
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:19,440
that are not eigenstates
of delta H. Therefore,

701
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,360
I cannot use the Feynman-Hellman
theorem until I find what are

702
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:28,499
the combinations that
are eigenstates of this

703
00:53:28,499 --> 00:53:29,040
perturbation.

704
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,380
So we are a little
bit in trouble.

705
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:43,010
Because we have a perturbation
for which these product

706
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:52,110
states-- we call them uncoupled
bases-- are not eigenstates.

707
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:56,850
Now, we've written this
operator a little naively.

708
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:01,270
What does this operator
really mean, S dot L?

709
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:15,030
In our tensor products,
it means S1 tensor L1.

710
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:19,180
Actually, I'll use
L dot S. I'll always

711
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:24,740
put the L information first and
the S information afterward.

712
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:29,850
So L dot S is clearly
an operator that

713
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:33,910
must be thought to act
on the tensor product.

714
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,830
Because both have to act.

715
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:37,990
S has to act and L has to act.

716
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:39,800
So it only lives in
the tensor product.

717
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,400
So what does it mean?

718
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:55,960
It means this-- S2 L2 plus S3
L3, or sum over i Si tensor Li.

719
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,860
So this is the kind of thing
that you need to understand--

720
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:05,080
how do you find for this
operator's eigenstates here?

721
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:16,400
So that is our difficulty.

722
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,910
And that's what
we have to solve.

723
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:23,770
We're going to solve it
in the next half hour.

724
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:31,140
So it's a complicated operator,
L dot S. But on the other hand,

725
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,780
we have to use our ideas
that we've learned already

726
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:40,090
about summing angular momenta.

727
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:49,310
What if I define
J to be L plus S,

728
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:58,545
which really means L
tensor 1 plus 1 tensor S?

729
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:09,130
So this is what I really
mean by this operator.

730
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:17,440
J, as we've demonstrated,
will be an angular momentum,

731
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,510
because this satisfies the
algebra of angular momentum

732
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:23,820
and this satisfies the
algebra of angular momentum.

733
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:28,280
So this thing satisfies the
algebra of angular momentum.

734
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:32,310
And why do we look at that term?

735
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:36,340
Because of the following reason.

736
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:39,590
We can square it-- JiJi.

737
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:48,870
Now we would have to
square this thing.

738
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:50,510
How do you square this thing?

739
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:52,590
Well, there's two ways.

740
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:56,060
Naively-- L squared
plus L squared plus 2L

741
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:59,285
dot S-- basically correct.

742
00:56:59,285 --> 00:57:01,750
But you can do it a
little more slowly.

743
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:07,120
If you square this term,
you get L squared tensor 1.

744
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:14,000
If you square this term,
you get 1 tensor S squared.

745
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,210
But when you do
the mixed products,

746
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:20,070
you just must take the
i's here and the i's here

747
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,250
and multiply them.

748
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:28,530
So actually, you do get two i's,
the sum over i Li tensor Si.

749
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:37,320
This is sum over i.

750
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,500
This is J squared.

751
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:50,420
So basically, what I'm saying
is that J squared naively

752
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:56,100
is L squared plus S squared
plus our interaction

753
00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:01,425
2L dot S defined property.

754
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:16,900
So L dot S is equal to 1/2
of J squared minus L squared

755
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,690
minus S squared.

756
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:26,020
And that tells you all kinds of
interesting things about L dot

757
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,470
S.

758
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:34,180
Basically, we can trade
L dot S for J squared,

759
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,490
L squared, and S squared.

760
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:39,590
L squared is very
simple, and S squared

761
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:42,190
is extremely simple as well.

762
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:46,520
Remember, L squared
commutes with any Li.

763
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:51,340
So L squared with
any Li is equal to 0.

764
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:55,740
S squared with any
Si is equal to 0.

765
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,180
And Li's and Si's commute.

766
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,780
They live in different worlds.

767
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:03,280
So L squared and Si's commute.

768
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,720
S squareds and Li's commute.

769
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:11,230
These things are
pretty nice and simple.

770
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:15,600
So let's think now
of our Hamiltonian

771
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:22,260
and what is happening to it.

772
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:31,260
Whenever we had
the hydrogen atom,

773
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:39,410
we had a set of commuting
observables H, L squared,

774
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,120
and Lz.

775
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:48,470
It's a complete set of
commuting observables.

776
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:53,020
Now, in the hydrogen
atom, you could add to it

777
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:57,620
S squared and Sz.

778
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:00,160
We didn't talk about
spin at the beginning,

779
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,760
because we just considered
a particle going

780
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,520
around the hydrogen atom.

781
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:09,330
But if you have spin, the
hydrogen atom Hamiltonian,

782
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:13,820
the original one, doesn't
involve spin in any way.

783
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,890
So certainly, Hamiltonian
commutes with spin,

784
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,740
with spin z.

785
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,880
L and S don't talk, so
this is the complete set

786
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,870
of commuting observables.

787
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:27,215
But what happens to this list?

788
01:00:27,215 --> 01:00:35,210
This is our problem for
H0, the hydrogen atom,

789
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:43,450
plus delta H that
has the S dot L.

790
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:49,100
Well, what are complete set
of commuting observables?

791
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,550
This is a very
important question.

792
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:53,560
Because this is
what tells you how

793
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,050
you're going to try to
organize the spectrum.

794
01:00:56,050 --> 01:01:01,880
So we could have H,
the total, H total.

795
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,960
And what else?

796
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:14,630
Well, can I still
have L squared here?

797
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:23,135
Can I include L squared and say
it commutes with the total H?

798
01:01:27,229 --> 01:01:30,170
A little worrisome,
but actually,

799
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:35,500
you know that L squared commutes
with the original Hamiltonian.

800
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,260
Now, the question is
whether L squared commutes

801
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,320
with this extra piece.

802
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,110
Well, but L squared
commutes with any Li.

803
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:47,730
And it doesn't even talk
to S. So L squared is safe.

804
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:50,400
L squared we can keep.

805
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,660
OK, S squared-- can
we keep S squared?

806
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,480
Well, S squared was here.

807
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,420
So it commuted with the
Hamiltonian, and that was good.

808
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:06,000
S squared commutes with any
Si, and it doesn't talk to L.

809
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,730
So S squared can stay.

810
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,550
But that's not good enough.

811
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:16,950
We won't be able to solve
the problem with this still.

812
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:17,790
We need more.

813
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,166
How about Lz?

814
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:24,885
It was here, so
let's try our luck.

815
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:32,340
Any opinions on Lz--
can we keep it or not?

816
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,838
Yes.

817
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,182
AUDIENCE: I don't think so.

818
01:02:40,182 --> 01:02:44,117
Because in the J term, we
have Lx's and Ly's, which

819
01:02:44,117 --> 01:02:45,340
don't commute with Lz.

820
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,980
PROFESSOR: Right,
it can't be kept.

821
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:57,540
Here, this term has SxLx
plus SyLy plus SzLz.

822
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:02,370
And Lz doesn't
commute with this one.

823
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:04,995
So no, you can't
keep Lz-- no good.

824
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:14,496
On the other hand, let's
think about J squared.

825
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:22,670
J squared is here.

826
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:26,685
And J squared commutes with
L squared and with S squared.

827
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:36,600
J squared, therefore, is--
well, let me say it this way.

828
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:42,460
Here is L dot S, which
is our extra interaction.

829
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:44,920
Here we have this thing.

830
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:49,700
I would like to say
on behalf of J squared

831
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:56,200
that we can include
it here, J squared,

832
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:00,840
because J squared is
really pretty much the same

833
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:05,860
as L dot S up to this L
squared and S squared.

834
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:09,640
But J squared commutes with
L squared and S squared.

835
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,400
I should probably
write it there.

836
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:22,350
J squared commutes
with L squared.

837
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:29,010
And J squared communicates with
S squared that we have here.

838
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:38,300
And moreover, we have over
here that J squared therefore

839
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:41,960
will commute, or it's
pretty much the same,

840
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:45,600
as L dot S. J squared
with L dot S would

841
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:50,810
be J squared times
this thing, which is 0.

842
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:55,840
So J squared commutes
with this term.

843
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:59,210
And it commutes with
the Hamiltonian,

844
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:02,410
your original
hydrogen Hamiltonian.

845
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:06,240
So J squared can be added here.

846
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:13,980
J square is a good
operator to have.

847
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:19,110
And now we can get one more
kind of free from here.

848
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:21,290
It's Jz.

849
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:23,280
Z

850
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:29,630
Because Jz commutes
with J squared.

851
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:32,140
Jz commutes with these things.

852
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:38,090
And Jz, which is a symmetry
of the original Hamiltonian,

853
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:44,342
also commutes with our new
interaction, the L dot S,

854
01:05:44,342 --> 01:05:47,770
which is proportional
to J squared.

855
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:53,340
So you have to go
through this yourselves

856
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:56,980
probably even a little
more slowly than I've gone.

857
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:59,660
Just check that
everything that I'm

858
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:02,480
saying about whatever
commutes commutes.

859
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,350
So for example, when I say
that J squared commutes

860
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:09,700
with L dot S, it's
because I can put

861
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,590
instead of L dot S all of this.

862
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:15,920
And go slowly through this.

863
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:22,030
So this is actually the complete
set of committing observables.

864
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:25,510
And it's basically
saying to us, try

865
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:31,755
to diagonalize this thing
with total angular momentum.

866
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:38,290
So it's about time
to really do it.

867
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:39,790
We haven't done it yet.

868
01:06:39,790 --> 01:06:43,930
But now the part that
we have to do now,

869
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:46,470
it's kind of a nice exercise.

870
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:48,970
And it's fun.

871
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:52,180
Now, there's one problem
in the homework set

872
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:55,710
that sort of uses
this kind of thing.

873
01:06:55,710 --> 01:07:01,850
And I will suggest there to
Will and Aram that tomorrow,

874
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:07,120
they spend some time discussing
it and helping you with it.

875
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,930
The last problem
in the homework set

876
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:15,060
would've been better if you
had a little more time for it

877
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:17,930
and you had more time to
digest what I'm doing today.

878
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:21,920
But nevertheless,
go to recitation,

879
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,490
learn more about the problem.

880
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:26,740
It will not be all
that difficult.

881
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:31,900
OK, so we're trying
now to finally form

882
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,890
another basis of states.

883
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:36,970
We had these six states.

884
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:39,020
And we're going to
try to organize them

885
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:45,480
in a better way-- as eigenstates
of the total angular momentum L

886
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:51,210
plus S. So I'm going to
write them here in this way.

887
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:58,830
Here is one of the
states of this L equals

888
01:07:58,830 --> 01:08:04,330
1 electron, the 1, 1
coupled to the 1/2, 1/2.

889
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:20,740
Here are two more states- 1, 0,
1/2, 1/2, 1, 1, 1/2, minus 1/2,

890
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:27,850
so the 1, 0 with the top,
the 1, 1 with the bottom.

891
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:35,020
Here are two more
states-- 1, 0 with 1/2,

892
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:43,620
minus 1/2 and 1,
minus 1 with 1/2, 1/2.

893
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:56,100
And here is the last state--
1, minus 1 with 1/2, minus 1.

894
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,832
These are our six states.

895
01:09:05,832 --> 01:09:09,654
And I've organized them
in a nice way actually.

896
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,990
I've organized
them in such a way

897
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:21,750
that you can read what is
the value of Jz over h bar.

898
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:28,563
Remember, Jz is 1
over h bar Lz plus Sz.

899
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,479
So what is it?

900
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:39,760
These are, I claim,
eigenstates of Jz.

901
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:40,899
Why?

902
01:09:40,899 --> 01:09:42,569
Because let's act on them.

903
01:09:42,569 --> 01:09:45,510
Suppose I act with
Jz on this state.

904
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:47,930
The Lz comes here and says, 1.

905
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:50,890
The Sz comes here and says, 1/2.

906
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:56,337
So the sum of them give you
Jz over h bar equal to 3/2.

907
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:05,240
And that's why I organized
these states in such a way

908
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:10,510
that these second things add up
to the same value-- 0 and 1/2,

909
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:12,590
1 and minus 1/2.

910
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:16,360
So if you act with
Jz on this state,

911
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,330
it's an eigenstate with Jz.

912
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:22,470
Here, 0 contribution, here 1/2.

913
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:26,700
So this is with plus 1/2.

914
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:31,130
Here, you have 0 and minus 1/2,
minus 1, and that is minus 1/2.

915
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,930
And here you have minus 3/2.

916
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:43,943
OK, questions.

917
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,330
We've written the states.

918
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:55,240
And I'm evaluating the total z
component of angular momentum.

919
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:58,470
And these two states
are like that.

920
01:10:58,470 --> 01:11:02,150
So what does our theorem
guarantee for us?

921
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:06,670
Our theorem guarantees that we
have-- in this tensor product,

922
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:10,770
there is an algebra of angular
momentum of the Jz operators.

923
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:14,270
And the states have to
fall into representations

924
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,930
of those operators.

925
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:19,920
So you must have angular
momentum multiplets.

926
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,710
So at this moment,
you can figure out

927
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:30,240
what angular momentum you're
going to get for the result.

928
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:36,770
Here we obtained a
maximum Jz of 3/2.

929
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:42,005
So we must get a J
equals 3/2 multiplet.

930
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,660
Because a J equaling
3/2 multiplets

931
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:55,650
has Jz 3/2, 1/2,
minus 1/2, and 0.

932
01:11:55,650 --> 01:12:01,510
So actually, this state must be
the top state of the multiplet.

933
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:05,500
This state must be the bottom
state of the multiplet.

934
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:10,160
I don't know which one is the
middle state of the multiplet

935
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,250
and which one is here.

936
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:15,670
But we have four states
here, four states.

937
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,940
So one linear combination
of these two states

938
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:29,190
must be, then, that Jz equals
1/2 state of the multiplet.

939
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:31,600
And one inner combination
of these two states

940
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,220
must be that Jz equals minus
1/2 state of the multiplet.

941
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,750
Which one is it?

942
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,180
I don't know.

943
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:40,010
But we can figure it out.

944
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:41,930
We'll figure it out in a second.

945
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:44,640
Once you get this
J 3/2 multiplet,

946
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,270
there will be one linear
combination here left over

947
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:51,500
and one linear combination
here left over.

948
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:56,300
Those are two state, one with
Jz plus 1/2 and one with Jz

949
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,060
equals minus 1/2.

950
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:01,740
So you also get a J
equals 1/2 multiplet.

951
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:11,290
So the whole tensor
product of six

952
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:18,260
states-- it was the
tensor product of a spin 1

953
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:21,620
with a spin 1/2.

954
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:24,560
So we write it like this.

955
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:32,940
The tensor product of a
spin 1 with a spin 1/2

956
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:43,660
will give you a total
spin 3/2 plus total spin

957
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:52,940
1/2-- funny formula.

958
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:56,820
Here is the tensor
product, the tensor

959
01:13:56,820 --> 01:14:01,710
product of these three
states with these two states.

960
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:08,720
This can be written as 3
times 2 is equal to 4 plus 2

961
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,870
in terms of number of states.

962
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:16,020
The tensor product of
this spin 1 and spin 1/2

963
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:21,040
gives you a spin 3/2
multiplet with four states

964
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,520
and a spin 1/2 multiplet
with two states.

965
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:33,040
So how do you calculate what
are the states themselves?

966
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:38,380
So the states themselves
are the following.

967
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:51,280
All right, here I have them.

968
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:57,560
I claim that the J
equals 3/2 states,

969
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:02,610
m equals 3/2 states, the
top state of that multiplet

970
01:15:02,610 --> 01:15:11,860
can only be the state here,
the 1, 1 tensor 1/2, 1/2.

971
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:18,490
And there's no way any other
state can be put on the right.

972
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:22,020
Because there's no other
state with total z component

973
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:24,160
of angular momentum equals 3/2.

974
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,490
So that must be the state.

975
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:33,000
Similarly, the J
equals 3/2, m equals

976
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:40,980
minus 3/2 state must be the
bottom one-- 1, minus 1, 1/2,

977
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:44,220
minus 1/2.

978
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:46,490
The one that we
wish to figure out

979
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:53,710
is the next state here, which is
the J equals 3/2, m equals 1/2.

980
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:57,200
It's a linear
combination of these two.

981
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,390
But which one?

982
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:05,250
That is kind of the last
thing we want to do.

983
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:08,520
Because it will pretty much
solve the rest of the problem.

984
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,540
So how do we solve for this?

985
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:25,270
Well, we had this
basic relation that we

986
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:36,470
know how to lower or raise
states of angular momentum--

987
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:43,530
m times m plus/minus 1 J--
I should have written it

988
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:52,510
J plus/minus Jm equals
h bar square root.

989
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:56,790
More space for everybody
to see this-- J times

990
01:16:56,790 --> 01:17:02,180
J plus 1 minus m
times m plus/minus 1.

991
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:08,120
Close the square
root-- Jm plus/minus 1.

992
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:14,020
So what I should try to
do is lower this state,

993
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:19,630
try to find this state
by acting with J minus.

994
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:22,660
So let me try to
lower the state, so

995
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:31,170
J minus on this state, on
J equals 3/2, m equals 3/2.

996
01:17:31,170 --> 01:17:39,770
I can go to that formula and
write it as h bar square root.

997
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:47,260
J is 3/2, so 3/2 times
5/2 minus m, which is 3/2,

998
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:49,960
times m minus 1, 1/2.

999
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:57,570
We're doing the minus--
times the state 3/2, 1/2.

1000
01:17:57,570 --> 01:18:00,030
So the state we want is here.

1001
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:03,570
And it's obtained by
doing J minus on that.

1002
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:05,320
But we want the number here.

1003
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:08,340
So that's why I did
all these square roots.

1004
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:16,650
And that just gives h bar
square root of 3, 3/2, 1/2.

1005
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:19,670
Well, that still doesn't
calculate it for me.

1006
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:21,510
But it comes very close.

1007
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:33,250
So you have it there.

1008
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:39,580
Now I want to do this but
using the right hand side.

1009
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:41,560
So look at the right hand side.

1010
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:52,570
We want to do J minus, but
on 1, 1 tensor 1/2, 1/2.

1011
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:55,820
So I applied J minus
to the left hand side.

1012
01:18:55,820 --> 01:19:01,130
Now we have to apply J minus
to the right hand side.

1013
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:19,680
But J minus is L minus plus S
minus on 1, 1 tensor 1/2, 1/2.

1014
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,750
When this acts, it
acts on the first.

1015
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:31,570
So you get L minus on
1, 1 tensor 1/2, 1/2.

1016
01:19:31,570 --> 01:19:38,280
And in the second term,
you get plus 1, 1 tensor S

1017
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,520
minus on 1/2, 1/2.

1018
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:47,540
Now, what is L minus on 1, 1?

1019
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:50,330
You can use the same formula.

1020
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:51,450
It's 1, 1.

1021
01:19:51,450 --> 01:19:53,250
And it's an angular momentum.

1022
01:19:53,250 --> 01:20:00,350
So it just goes on and
gives you h bar square

1023
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:05,520
root of 1 times 2
minus 1 times 0.

1024
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:10,720
1, 0-- it lowers
it-- times 1/2, 1/2.

1025
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:19,270
Let me go here-- plus 1, 1.

1026
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:21,980
And what is S minus on this?

1027
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:26,390
Use the formula
with J equals 1/2.

1028
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:37,460
So this is h bar square root of
1/2 times 3/2 minus 1/2 times

1029
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:43,522
minus 1/2 times 1/2 minus 1/2.

1030
01:20:43,522 --> 01:20:48,620
Whew-- well not too difficult.

1031
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:57,630
But this gives you h over square
root of 2, 1, 0 tensor 1/2,

1032
01:20:57,630 --> 01:21:01,440
1/2 plus just h bar.

1033
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:11,030
This whole thing is 1-- 1,
1 tensor 1/2, minus 1/2.

1034
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:16,800
OK, stop a second to
see what's happened.

1035
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,730
We had this equality.

1036
01:21:18,730 --> 01:21:20,260
And we acted with J minus.

1037
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:23,390
Acting on the left,
it gives us a number

1038
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:25,980
times the state we want.

1039
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:29,950
Acting on the
right, we got this.

1040
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:36,220
So actually, equating this
to that, or left hand side

1041
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:41,270
to right hand side, we finally
found the state 3/2, 1/2.

1042
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:49,630
So the state 3/2,
1/2 is as follows.

1043
01:21:54,410 --> 01:22:06,930
3/2, 1/2 is-- you must
divide by that square root.

1044
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:09,435
So you get the square
root of 3 down.

1045
01:22:09,435 --> 01:22:12,280
The h bars cancel.

1046
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:18,290
So here it is, a very nice
little formula-- 2 over 3,

1047
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:26,450
1, 0 tensor 1/2, 1/2 plus
1 over square root of 3,

1048
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:34,010
1, 1 tensor 1/2, minus 1/2.

1049
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:36,730
So we have the top
state of the multiplet.

1050
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:43,910
We have the next state
of the multiplet.

1051
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:47,240
We have-- I'm sorry, the
top state of the multiplet

1052
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,250
was this.

1053
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:51,830
You have the bottom
state of the multiplet,

1054
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:53,890
the middle state
of the multiplet.

1055
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:58,920
What you're missing is the
bottom and the middle term.

1056
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:02,935
And this one can be
obtained in many ways.

1057
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:08,990
One way would be to
raise this state.

1058
01:23:08,990 --> 01:23:12,330
The minus 3/2 could
be raised by one unit

1059
01:23:12,330 --> 01:23:14,710
and do exactly the same thing.

1060
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:24,760
Well, the result is square root
of 2 over 3, 1, 0 tensor 1/2,

1061
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:30,550
minus 1/2 plus 1 over
square root of 3.

1062
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:35,240
That square root of 2
doesn't look right to me now.

1063
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,830
I must have copied it wrong.

1064
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:43,940
It's 1 over square root of
3-- 1 over square root of 3,

1065
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:50,660
1, minus 1 tensor 1/2, 1/2.

1066
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:52,365
So you've built that
whole multiplet.

1067
01:23:55,420 --> 01:24:00,480
And this state, as we said,
was a linear combination

1068
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,996
of the two possible states.

1069
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:09,430
This 3 minus 1/2 was
a linear combination

1070
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:11,530
of these two possible states.

1071
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:14,690
So the other states
that are left over,

1072
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:17,785
the other linear
combinations, form

1073
01:24:17,785 --> 01:24:21,090
the J equals 1/2 multiplet.

1074
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:26,050
So basically, every state must
be orthogonal to each other.

1075
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:35,200
So the other state, the 1/2, 1/2
and the 1/2, minus 1/2 of the J

1076
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:41,430
equals 1/2 multiplet must
be this orthogonal to this.

1077
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:44,810
And this must be
orthogonal to that.

1078
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:50,760
So those formulas are easily
found by orthogonality.

1079
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:56,760
So I'll conclude by
writing them-- minus 1

1080
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:04,010
over square root of
3, 1, 0, 1/2, 1/2

1081
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:13,170
plus the square root of 2
over 3, 1, 1, 1/2, minus 1/2.

1082
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:19,770
And here, you get 1 over
square root of 3, 1, 0, 1/2,

1083
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:31,340
minus 1/2 minus 2 over
square root of 3, 1, minus 1

1084
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:33,380
tensor 1/2, 1/2.

1085
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:45,870
So lots of terms, a little
hard to read-- I apologize.

1086
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:53,120
Now, the punchline here is
that you've found these states.

1087
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:57,050
And the claim is
that these are states

1088
01:25:57,050 --> 01:26:00,610
in which L dot S is diagonal.

1089
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:04,310
And it's kind of obvious
that that should be the case.

1090
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:07,830
Because what was L dot S?

1091
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:20,150
So one last formula--
L dot S equals

1092
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:26,220
1/2 of J squared minus L
squared minus S squared.

1093
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:29,770
Now, in terms of
eigenvalues, this

1094
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:36,930
is 1/2 h squared J times
J plus 1 minus L times L

1095
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:42,440
plus 1 minus S times S plus 1.

1096
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:45,160
Now, all the states
that we built

1097
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:48,070
have definite
values of J squared,

1098
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:50,450
definite values of S squared.

1099
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:52,740
Because L was 1.

1100
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:55,270
And S is 1/2.

1101
01:26:55,270 --> 01:27:03,400
So here you go h squared over 2
J times J plus 1 minus 1 times

1102
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:09,450
2 is 2 minus 1/2
times 3/2 is 3/4.

1103
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:13,630
And that's the whole story.

1104
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:17,170
The whole story in a sense
has been summarized by this.

1105
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:22,210
We have four states
with J equals 3/2

1106
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:25,850
and two states
with J equals 1/2.

1107
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:31,190
So these six states
that you have here--

1108
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:33,690
split because of
this interaction

1109
01:27:33,690 --> 01:27:42,700
into four states that have
J equal to 3/2 and two

1110
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:47,370
states that have J equal to 1/2.

1111
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:49,640
And you plug the numbers here.

1112
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,456
And that gives you the
amount of splitting.

1113
01:27:54,790 --> 01:28:02,810
So actually, this height
that this goes up here

1114
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:05,230
is h squared over 2.

1115
01:28:05,230 --> 01:28:08,030
And this is minus h
squared by the time you

1116
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:11,860
put the numbers J, 3/2, and 1/2.

1117
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:17,220
So all our work was because
the Hamiltonian at the end

1118
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:20,360
was simple in J squared.

1119
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,240
And therefore, we
needed J multiplets.

1120
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:27,900
J multiplets are the addition
of angular momentum multiplets.

1121
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:31,270
In a sense, we don't have
to construct these things

1122
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:34,910
if you don't want to calculate
very explicit details.

1123
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:37,960
Once you have that,
you have everything.

1124
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:42,620
This product of angular
momentum 1, angular momentum 1/2

1125
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:45,800
gave you total
angular momentum 3/2

1126
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:48,990
and 1/2-- four
states, two states.

1127
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:53,380
So four states split one way,
two states split the other way,

1128
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:55,210
and that's the end of the story.

1129
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:58,340
So more of this in recitation
and more of this all

1130
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:00,580
of next week.

1131
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:02,790
We'll see you then.
