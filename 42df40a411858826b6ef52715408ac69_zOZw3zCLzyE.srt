8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:27,620
PROFESSOR: OK, so let me go
back to what we were doing.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,090
The plan for today
is as follows.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,240
We're going to look at
this unitary time evolution

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,800
and calculate this operator
u, given the Hamiltonian.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,170
That will be the first
order of business today.

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,660
Then we will look
at the Heisenberg

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,090
picture of quantum mechanics.

15
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,270
And the Heisenberg picture
of quantum mechanics

16
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,140
is one where the operators,
the Schrodinger operators,

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,510
acquire time dependence.

18
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:07,480
And it's a pretty useful way of
seeing things, a pretty useful

19
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,620
way of calculating
things as well,

20
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,360
and makes the relation between
classical mechanics and quantum

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,270
mechanics more obvious.

22
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,530
So it's a very important tool.

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,890
So we'll discuss that.

24
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,020
We'll find the Heisenberg
equations of motion

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,270
and solve them for a
particular case today.

26
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:36,290
All this material is not so
to be covered in the test.

27
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,740
The only part-- of course,
the first few things

28
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,750
I will say today about solving
for the unitary operator

29
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,770
you've done in other ways, and
I will do it again this time.

30
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,510
So going back to what we
were saying last time,

31
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,570
we postulated unitary
time evolution.

32
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:06,300
We said that psi at t was given
by some operator U of t t0 psi

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,800
t0.

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,170
And then we found
that this equation

35
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,870
implied the Schrodinger
equation with a Hamiltonian

36
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,480
given by the
following expression.

37
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:32,830
ih dU dt of t t0
u dagger of t t0.

38
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,740
So that was our derivation
of the Schrodinger equation.

39
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,820
We start with the
time evolution.

40
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,070
We found that, whenever we
declare that states evolve

41
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,870
in time in that way, they
satisfy a first order time

42
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,230
differential equation
of the Schrodinger form

43
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:56,491
in which the Hamiltonian
is given in terms of U

44
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:58,240
by this equation.

45
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,160
And we talked about
this operator.

46
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,890
First we showed that it
doesn't depend really on t0.

47
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,250
Then we showed that
it's Hermitian.

48
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,430
It has units of energy.

49
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:15,020
And as you may have seen
already in the notes,

50
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,610
there is a very
clear correspondence

51
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,330
between this
operator and the way

52
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:29,870
the dynamics follows with
the ideas of Poisson brackets

53
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,740
that are the precursors
of commutators

54
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,480
from classical mechanics.

55
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,040
So that's in the notes.

56
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,050
I will not go in detail in this.

57
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,130
Many of you may have not
heard of Poisson brackets.

58
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,880
It's an interesting
thing, and really that

59
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,680
will be good enough.

60
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,180
So our goal today
is to find U given

61
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,740
H, because as we mentioned
last time, for physics

62
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,380
it is typically more
easy to invent a quantum

63
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,340
system by postulating
a Hamiltonian

64
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,290
and then solving it than
postulating a time evolution

65
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,180
operator.

66
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:24,270
So our goal in general is to
find U of t t0 given H of t.

67
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,060
That's what we're
supposed to do.

68
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,320
So the first thing
I'm going to do

69
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,510
is multiply this equation by u.

70
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,500
By multiplying this equation
by a u from the right,

71
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:50,110
I will write first this
term. ih dU dt of t t0

72
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,012
is equal to H of t U of t t0.

73
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,990
So I multiplied this
equation by u from the right.

74
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,090
This operator is unitary,
so u dagger u is one.

75
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,430
That's why this equation
cleaned up to this.

76
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,420
Now there's no confusion
really here with derivatives,

77
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,930
so I might this well write
them with normal derivatives.

78
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:27,886
So I'll write this
equation as d dt of U t t0

79
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:31,780
is equal to H of t U of t t0.

80
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,960
You should be able to
look at that equation

81
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,230
and say I see the
Schrodinger equation there.

82
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,930
How?

83
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:59,720
Imagine that you have a psi
of t0 here, and you put it in.

84
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,730
Then the right hand side becomes
h and t acting on psi of t.

85
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:14,110
And on the left hand
side, this psi of t0

86
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,200
can be put inside the derivative
because it doesn't depend on t.

87
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,640
Therefore this becomes
ih bar d dt of psi of t.

88
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,530
So the Schrodinger
equation is there.

89
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,850
OK so now let's solve this.

90
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,680
We'll go through three cases.

91
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,400
Case one, h is time independent.

92
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,480
So we're doing this
sort of quickly.

93
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,240
So H of t is really H like that.

94
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,700
No explicit time
dependence there.

95
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,510
So what do we have?

96
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,730
ih bar.

97
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:13,210
Let's write dU dt
is equal H times U.

98
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,020
And we tried to write a
solution of the form U

99
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:24,630
use equal to e to the minus
iHt over h bar times U0.

100
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,600
Does that work?

101
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:40,030
Well, we can think du dt and ih.

102
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,090
So we get ih.

103
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:48,420
When I take dU dt, I have to
differentiate this exponential.

104
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:53,530
And now in this exponential,
this full operator H is there.

105
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,850
But we are differentiating
with respect to time.

106
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,970
And H doesn't depend
on time, so this is not

107
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,330
a very difficult situation.

108
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,640
You could imagine the
power series expansion.

109
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,340
And H, as far as
this derivative goes,

110
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,340
is like if it would
be even a number.

111
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,200
It wouldn't make any
difference if it's an operator.

112
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,040
So the derivative with
respect to time of this thing

113
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,600
is minus iH over h times
the same exponential.

114
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,159
Moreover, the position
of this h could be here,

115
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,419
or it could be to the right.

116
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,030
It cannot be to the
right of U0 though,

117
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,630
because this is a matrix, a
constant matrix that we've put

118
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,590
in here as a possible thing
for boundary condition.

119
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,320
So so far we've taken
this derivative,

120
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,706
and then i's cancel, the h
bar cancels, and you get H.

121
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:07,340
But this whole
thing is, again, U.

122
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,940
So the equation has been solved.

123
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,440
So try this.

124
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,630
And it works.

125
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:25,120
So having this solution
we can write, for example,

126
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,410
that U of t t0 is going
to be e to the minus

127
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:38,110
iHt over h bar, some
constant matrix.

128
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:44,940
When t is equal to t0, this
matrix becomes the unit matrix.

129
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,180
So this is e to the minus
iHt0 over h bar times U0.

130
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,140
And therefore from
here, U0 is the inverse

131
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:06,520
of this matrix, which is nothing
else but e to the iHt0 over h

132
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,140
bar.

133
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:18,910
So I can substitute back
here what U0 is and finally

134
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:31,170
obtain U of t t0 is e to the
minus iH over h bar t minus t0.

135
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:41,180
And this is for h
time independent.

136
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,900
And that's our solution.

137
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,435
There's very little
to add to this.

138
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,710
We discussed that in
recitation on Thursday.

139
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,560
This unitary operator
you've been seeing that

140
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,420
from the beginning of
the course in some sense,

141
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,800
that you evolve
energy eigenstate.

142
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,110
If this acts on any
energy eigenstate,

143
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:13,380
h is an energy-- if you act
here on an energy eigenstate,

144
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,030
the energy eigenstate is an
eigenstate precisely for H,

145
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,670
you can put just
the number here.

146
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:26,700
That is e to the, say,
alpha h on a state psi

147
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:38,290
n is equal to e to the
alpha en psi n if h on psi n

148
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,110
is equal to en on psi n.

149
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:48,910
So the function of an operator
acting on an eigenstate

150
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:54,560
is just the function
evaluated at the eigenvalue.

151
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:01,600
So this is a rule that you've
been using a really long time.

152
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,140
OK, so when h is time
independent, that's what it is.

153
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,110
How about when h has a
little time dependence?

154
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,880
What do I call a
little time dependence?

155
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,590
A little time dependence
is an idea, the sign

156
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:24,050
to make it possible for
you to solve the equation,

157
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,800
even though it has
some time dependence.

158
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,180
So you could have Hamiltonians
that are time dependent,

159
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,870
but still have a
simplifying virtue.

160
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:40,290
So H of t is time dependent.

161
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:54,655
But assume that H at t1 and h
at t2 commute for all t1 and t2.

162
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,140
So what could that be?

163
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,890
For example, you know that the
particle in a magnetic field,

164
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:15,435
the spin in a magnetic field
is minus gamma B dot the spin.

165
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:24,970
And you could have a time
dependent magnetic field, B

166
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,380
of t times the spin.

167
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,680
I'm not sure this is the
constant gamma that they

168
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,570
usually call gamma,
but it may be.

169
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:41,500
Now then if the magnetic field
is time dependent, but imagine

170
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,350
its direction is
not time dependent.

171
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:51,690
So if its direction is not time
dependent, then, for example,

172
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:59,450
you would have here minus
gamma Bz of t times Sz.

173
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,250
And the Hamiltonian at
different times commute

174
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,260
because Sz commutes with itself,
and the fact that it's time

175
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:12,770
independent doesn't
make it fail to commute.

176
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:17,900
So if you have a magnetic field
that is fixed in one direction

177
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,330
but change in time, you
can have a situation where

178
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,370
your Hamiltonian
is time dependent,

179
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,970
but still at different
times it commutes.

180
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,640
And you will discuss such
case because it's interesting.

181
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,290
But later on as we do
nuclear magnetic resonance,

182
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,550
we will have the
more interesting case

183
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,400
in which a magnetic field
rotates and therefore it's

184
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,900
not that simple.

185
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:49,540
So what happens if you have a
time dependent Hamiltonian that

186
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,560
actually commutes?

187
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,780
Well, the claim
is that U of t t0

188
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:02,660
is given by a natural extension
of what we had before.

189
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:08,000
You would want to put
exponential of minus iHt,

190
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,880
but the reason this worked
was because the derivative

191
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,880
with respect to time brought
down an iH over h bar.

192
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:24,140
So one way to fix this is to
put t t0 H of t prime dt prime.

193
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,635
So this is an
answer to try this.

194
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,630
Look at this.

195
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,810
If the Hamiltonian were
to be time independent,

196
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,520
you could take it out.

197
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,480
And then you would
get t minus t0.

198
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,390
That brings you back to this
case, so this looks reasonable.

199
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:58,280
So let me call this
quantity R of t.

200
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:05,660
And then you notice
that R dot of t,

201
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,050
the derivative of this
quantity with respect to time.

202
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,090
Well, when you differentiate
an integral the upper argument,

203
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,460
you get just the
integrand evaluated

204
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,350
at the time represented
by the upper argument

205
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,140
of the upper limit
of integration.

206
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,645
So this is H of t.

207
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:36,370
And now here comes
a crucial point.

208
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,900
You're trying to differentiate.

209
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,580
This U is really e
to the R. And you're

210
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:49,910
trying to differentiate to see
if the equation holds dU dt.

211
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,480
So what is the dU dt?

212
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:05,897
Would be d dt of 1 plus R
plus RR plus 1 3 factor RRR.

213
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,520
And now what happens?

214
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:23,280
You differentiate here, and
the first term is R dot.

215
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,520
Here You, would have one
half R dot R plus R R dot.

216
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,480
And then 1 over 3 factorial,
but three factors.

217
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:46,910
R dot RR plus R R
dot R plus RR R dot.

218
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,720
But here is the
claim R dot commutes

219
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:09,050
with R. Claim R
dot and R commute.

220
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,470
Why is that?

221
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:16,320
Well, R dot depends on
H. And R is an integral

222
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,850
of H as well, but the H
at different times commute

223
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,610
anyway, so this must be true.

224
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,250
There's no place where you
can get a contribution,

225
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:30,100
because R dot is like an H,
and here's an integral of H.

226
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,270
So since the Hamiltonians
are assumed to commute,

227
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,470
R dot commutes with
R. And this becomes

228
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,820
like a normal derivative of
an exponential in which you

229
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,840
can move the R dot to
the left everywhere.

230
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,270
And you're differentiating
the usual thing.

231
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:59,240
So this is R dot and times
the exponential of R.

232
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,800
So actually that
means that we've

233
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:07,010
got pretty much our answer,
because R dot is minus

234
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:11,300
i over h bar H of t.

235
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:17,810
And e to the R is U,
so we got dU dt equals

236
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,330
this, which is the
same as this equation.

237
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:39,140
The only reason a derivative
with respect to time will not

238
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:45,880
give the usual thing is if
R and R dot fail to commute,

239
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,790
and they don't.

240
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,810
So you could put the R dot here.

241
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,840
You can put R dot
on the other side,

242
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,660
because it commutes with
R, but it's better here.

243
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:01,800
And therefore you've got
this very nice solution.

244
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,650
So the solution is not that bad.

245
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,790
Now finally, I want to discuss
for a second the general case.

246
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:20,806
So that's case-- there was a
1, a 2, a 3 H of t general.

247
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,270
What can you do?

248
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,570
Well, if H of t is
general, there's

249
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,560
not too much you can do.

250
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,350
You can write
something that will

251
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,570
get you started doing
things, but it's not

252
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,310
obviously terribly useful.

253
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:45,060
But it's interesting
anyway that there's

254
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,530
a way to write something
that makes sense.

255
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,830
So here it is.

256
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,450
U of t and t0.

257
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:58,230
I'll write the answer
and explain how it looks,

258
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:04,090
and then you will
see that it's OK.

259
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,200
It's interesting.

260
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,710
But it probably is not
the most practical way

261
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,895
you can solve this problem.

262
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,790
So here it is.

263
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,680
There's an acronym
for this thing.

264
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,900
T it's called the time
ordered exponential.

265
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,750
This operator does something
to the exponential function.

266
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,470
So it's a definition.

267
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,350
So I have to say what
this time ordered

268
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:37,830
exponential is, and
it's the following.

269
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,970
You take the exponential
and just begin to expand.

270
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:45,217
So 1 minus i over
h bar-- or I'll

271
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:51,790
put like this, plus minus
i over h bar integral

272
00:21:51,790 --> 00:22:01,360
from t0 to t of dt1 H of t1.

273
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,130
So far, so good.

274
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,270
I've just expanded this.

275
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,960
Now if I would
continue expanding,

276
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,460
I would get something that
doesn't provide the solution.

277
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,110
You see, this thing
is the solution

278
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,580
when the Hamiltonian at
different times commute.

279
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,910
So it's unlikely to
be the solution when

280
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,000
they don't commute.

281
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,610
In fact, it's not the solution.

282
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,730
So what is the next term here?

283
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,390
The next term is you
think of the exponential

284
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,180
as you would expand as usual.

285
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:43,010
So you will have here plus one
half of this thing squared.

286
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:48,320
So I will put something and then
erase it, so maybe don't copy.

287
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,370
One half minus i
over h bar squared.

288
00:22:53,370 --> 00:23:02,700
And you would say, well, t0
to t dt prime H of t prime.

289
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:10,680
t0 to t dt double prime
H of double prime.

290
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,010
Well, that would be
just an exponential.

291
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:16,620
So what is a time
ordered exponential?

292
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,480
You erase the one half.

293
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:26,885
And then for notation
call this t1 and t1.

294
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:37,210
And then the next integral
do it only up to time t1,

295
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,375
and call this t2.

296
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:49,670
So t1 will always
be greater than t2,

297
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,760
because t2 is integrated
from t0 to t1.

298
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,410
And as you integrate here over
the various t1's, you just

299
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,740
integrate up to that value.

300
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,580
So you're doing less
of the full integral

301
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,210
then you should be
doing, and that's

302
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:12,080
why the factor of one
half has disappeared.

303
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,350
This can be continued.

304
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:19,330
I can write the next one would
be minus i over h bar cubed

305
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:33,080
integral t0 to t H of t1
integral t0 to t1 dt2 H of t2.

306
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,370
And then they next
integral goes up to t2.

307
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:41,315
So t0 to t2 dt3 H of t3.

308
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,190
Anyway, that's a time
ordered exponential.

309
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:58,970
And I leave it to you to
take the time derivative,

310
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,660
at least to see that the first
few terms are working exactly

311
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,550
the way they should.

312
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,940
That is, if you take a
time derivative of this,

313
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,710
you will get H times that thing.

314
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,670
So since it's a
power series, you

315
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,950
will differentiate
the first term,

316
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,680
and you will get
the right thing.

317
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,710
Then the second term and you
will start getting everything

318
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:25,310
that you need.

319
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,770
So it's a funny object.

320
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,950
It's reassuring that
something like this success,

321
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,150
but in general, you
would want to be

322
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:37,560
able to do all these
integrals and to sum them up.

323
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,420
And in general,
it's not that easy.

324
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,370
So it's of limited usefulness.

325
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,670
It's a nice thing
that you can write it,

326
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:52,570
and you can prove things
about it and manipulate it.

327
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,750
But when you have a
practical problem,

328
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,820
generally that's not
the way you solve it.

329
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,920
In fact, when we will discuss
the rotating magnetic fields

330
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,680
for magnetic resonance, we
will not solve it in this way.

331
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,870
We will try to figure out
the solution some other way.

332
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,290
But in terms of
completeness, it's

333
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,150
kind of pretty in
that you go from

334
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,230
the exponential to the
time ordered exponential.

335
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:24,080
And I think you'll see
more of this in 806.

336
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,100
So that's basically
our solution for H

337
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:35,200
and for the unitary
operator U in terms of H.

338
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,810
And what we're
going to do now is

339
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:39,170
turn to the Heisenberg
picture of quantum mechanics.

340
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,300
Yes, questions?

341
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,176
AUDIENCE: Why does
R dot [INAUDIBLE]?

342
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:53,090
PROFESSOR: Because that's
really a property of integrals.

343
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:59,180
d dx integral up
to x from x0 g of x

344
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:07,360
prime dx prime is
just equal to g of x.

345
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,570
This is a constant
here, so you're not

346
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,310
varying the integral
over in this limit.

347
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:16,170
So if this limit would
also be x dependent,

348
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,830
you would get
another contribution,

349
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,290
but we only get the
contribution from here.

350
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,640
What's really happening
is you're integrating up

351
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,740
to x, then up to x plus
epsilon subtracting,

352
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,810
so you pick up the value of the
function of the upper limit.

353
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:31,800
Yes?

354
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,740
AUDIENCE: So what happens to
the T that was pre factor?

355
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,452
PROFESSOR: What
happens to this T?

356
00:27:37,452 --> 00:27:38,660
AUDIENCE: Yeah, what happens?

357
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,830
PROFESSOR: That's just a symbol.

358
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:45,280
It says time order the
following exponential.

359
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,370
So at this stage,
this is a definition

360
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:52,670
of what t on an
exponential means.

361
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,140
AUDIENCE: OK.

362
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,260
PROFESSOR: It's not--
let me say T is not

363
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,290
an operator in the usual
sense of quantum mechanics

364
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,490
or anything like that.

365
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,680
It's an instruction.

366
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,560
Whenever you have an
exponential of this form,

367
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,380
the time ordered
exponential is this series

368
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,050
that we've written down.

369
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,250
It's just a definition.

370
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:14,926
Yes?

371
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,050
AUDIENCE: So when we have
operators in differential

372
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,850
equations, do we
still get [INAUDIBLE]?

373
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,600
PROFESSOR: If we have what?

374
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,933
AUDIENCE: If we have operators
in differential equations

375
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:27,500
do we still get unique
[INAUDIBLE] solutions?

376
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,680
PROFESSOR: Yes, pretty much.

377
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,930
Because at the end
of the day, this

378
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:37,940
is a first order matrix
differential equation.

379
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,730
So it's a collection of first
order differential equations

380
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,445
for every element of a matrix.

381
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,760
It's pretty much the
same as you have before.

382
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,440
If you know the operator
at any time, initial time,

383
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,980
with the differential
equation you know the operator

384
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,510
at a little bit time later.

385
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,460
So the operator is
completely determined

386
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,280
if you know it initially and
the differential equation.

387
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,930
So I think it's
completely analogous.

388
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,890
It's just that it's
harder to solve.

389
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,150
Nothing else.

390
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,556
One last question.

391
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:18,306
AUDIENCE: So let's say
that we can somehow

392
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:21,620
fly in this unitary operator,
and then we have a differential

393
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,859
equation, and we
somehow, let's say, get

394
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:27,400
a wave function out of it.

395
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,140
What is the interpretation
of that wave function?

396
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,515
PROFESSOR: Well,
it's not that we

397
00:29:31,515 --> 00:29:34,040
get the wave
function out of this.

398
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,300
What really is
happening is that you

399
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:45,020
have learned how to calculate
this operator given H.

400
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:49,330
And therefore now you're able
to evolve any wave function.

401
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,940
So you have solved
the dynamical system.

402
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:55,690
If somebody tells you a time
equals 0, your system is here,

403
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:59,270
you can now calculate where it's
going to be at the later time.

404
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,200
So that's really all
you have achieved.

405
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,537
You now know the solution.

406
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,370
When you're doing
mechanics and they ask you

407
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,060
for an orbit problem,
they say at this time

408
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,130
the planet is here.

409
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,980
What are you supposed to find?

410
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,830
x is a function of time.

411
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,910
You now know how it's
going to develop.

412
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,040
You've solved
equations of motion.

413
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,860
Here it's the same.

414
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,020
You know the wave
function of time equals.

415
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,490
If you know it at any time,
you've solved problem.

416
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,650
OK, so Heisenberg picture
of quantum mechanics.

417
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,230
Heisenberg picture.

418
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:48,540
So basically the
Heisenberg picture

419
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:54,210
exists thanks to the existence
of the Schrodinger picture.

420
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,240
Heisenberg picture
of quantum mechanics

421
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,690
is not something
that you necessarily

422
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,380
invent from the beginning.

423
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:05,190
The way we think of it is we
assume there is a Schrodinger

424
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:10,020
picture that we've developed in
which we have operators like x,

425
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,790
p, spin, Hamiltonians,
and wave functions.

426
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:19,020
And then we are going to
define a new way of thinking

427
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,840
about this, which is
called the Heisenberg

428
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,040
picture of the
quantum mechanics.

429
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:29,690
So it all begins by considering
a Schrodinger operator

430
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:35,070
As hat, which is s
is for Schrodinger.

431
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:48,700
And the motivation comes
from expectation values.

432
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,190
Suppose you have time
dependent states,

433
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,440
in fact, matrix elements.

434
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,780
One time dependent state alpha
of t, one time dependent state

435
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,640
beta of t.

436
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,000
Two independent time
dependent states.

437
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:17,090
So you could ask what is
the matrix element of A

438
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,520
between these two time dependent
states, a matrix element.

439
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:31,800
But then, armed with
our unitary operator,

440
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:37,980
we know that As is here, and
this state beta at time t

441
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:47,190
is equal to U of t
comma 0 beta at time 0.

442
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:53,390
And alpha t is equal to
alpha at 0 U dagger of t0.

443
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,590
So the states have
time dependence.

444
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,280
But the time
dependence has already

445
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,850
been found, say, in principle,
if you know U dagger.

446
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:13,200
And then you can speak about the
time dependent matrix elements

447
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,510
of the operator As
or the matrix element

448
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:24,960
of this time dependent
operator between the time

449
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,480
equals 0 states.

450
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,820
And this operator is
sufficiently important

451
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,520
that this operator is
called the Heisenberg

452
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,760
version of the operator s.

453
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,685
Has time dependence, and it's
defined by this equation.

454
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:57,560
So whenever you have
Schrodinger operator,

455
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:02,190
whether it be time dependent
or time independent,

456
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,790
whatever the
Schrodinger operator is,

457
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,150
I have now a
definition of what I

458
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:11,409
will call the
Heisenberg operator.

459
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:17,719
And it is obtained by acting
with a unitary operator, U.

460
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:23,900
And operators always act
on operators from the left

461
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,360
and from the right.

462
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:30,000
That's something that operators
act on states from the left.

463
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,850
They act on the state.

464
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:35,730
But operators act on
operator from the left

465
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,360
and from the right,
as you see them here,

466
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,739
is the natural, ideal
thing to happen.

467
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:45,510
If you have an operator that's
on another from the right only

468
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,969
or from the left
only, I think you

469
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:50,270
have grounds to be
suspicious that maybe you're

470
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:53,000
not doing things right.

471
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,440
So this is the
Heisenberg operator.

472
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,360
And as you can
imagine, there's a lot

473
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,090
of things to be said
about this operator.

474
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,060
So let's begin with a remark.

475
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:07,970
Are there questions about
this Heisenberg operator.

476
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:08,700
Yes?

477
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,180
AUDIENCE: Do we know anything
about the Schrodinger operator?

478
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,680
PROFESSOR: You have
to speak louder.

479
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,221
AUDIENCE: Is the
Schrodinger operator

480
00:35:15,221 --> 00:35:17,850
related to the
Hamiltonian [INAUDIBLE]?

481
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,830
PROFESSOR: Any
Schrodinger operator,

482
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,260
this could be the
Hamiltonian, this

483
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:27,550
could be x hat, it
could be Sz, could

484
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,090
be any of the
operators you know.

485
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:34,420
All the operators you know
are Schrodinger operators.

486
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,330
So remarks, comments.

487
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,306
OK, comments.

488
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:57,730
One, at t equals 0
A Heisenberg becomes

489
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:05,630
identical to A
Schrodinger at t equals 0.

490
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,300
So look why.

491
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:22,260
Because when t is equal to 0,
U of t-- of 0 0 is the operator

492
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:26,020
propagates no state, so
it's equal to the identity.

493
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,980
So this is a wonderful
relation that

494
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:34,220
tell us you that time equals
0 the two operators are really

495
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,190
the same.

496
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,880
And another simple remark.

497
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,440
If you have the unit operator
in the Schrodinger picture,

498
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,210
what is the unit operator
in the Heisenberg picture?

499
00:36:49,210 --> 00:37:00,790
Well, it would be U
t 0 dagger 1 U t 0.

500
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,300
But 1 doesn't matter.

501
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,890
U dagger with U is 1.

502
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,460
This is a 1 Schrodinger,
and therefore it's

503
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,300
the same operator.

504
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:16,170
So the unit operator
is the same.

505
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:20,300
It just doesn't
change whatsoever.

506
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,080
OK, so that's good.

507
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,470
But now this is something
interesting also happens.

508
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:31,380
Suppose you have
Schrodinger operator

509
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:37,526
C that is equal to the product
of A with B, two Schrodingers.

510
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,460
If I try to figure
out what is CH,

511
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,640
I would put U dagger-- avoid
all the letters, the t 0.

512
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,750
It's supposed to be t 0.

513
00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:07,520
Cs U. But that's equal
U dagger As Bs U.

514
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,270
But now, in between
the two operators,

515
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:14,980
you can put a U U dagger,
which is equal to 1.

516
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:23,670
So As U U dagger
Bs U. And then you

517
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,780
see why this is really nice.

518
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:31,890
Because what do you get is
that C Heisenberg is just

519
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,650
A Heisenberg times B Heisenberg.

520
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:38,882
So if you have C Schrodinger
equals A Schrodinger, B

521
00:38:38,882 --> 00:38:45,330
Schrodinger, C Heisenberg is
A Heisenberg B Heisenberg.

522
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:49,260
So there's a nice correspondence
between those operators.

523
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:58,670
Also you can do is
for commutators.

524
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,350
So you don't have to
worry about this thing.

525
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:13,500
So for example, if A
Schrodinger with B Schrodinger

526
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:19,380
is equal to C Schrodinger,
then by doing exactly

527
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:27,760
the same things, you see that
A Heisenberg with B Heisenberg

528
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,400
would be the commutator
equal to C Heisenberg.

529
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,670
Yes?

530
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,828
AUDIENCE: That argument
for the identity operators

531
00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:41,120
being the same in both pictures.

532
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,970
If the Hamiltonian
is time independent,

533
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,470
does that work for any
operator that commutes

534
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,727
with the Hamiltonian?

535
00:39:48,727 --> 00:39:50,310
PROFESSOR: Hamiltonian
is [INAUDIBLE].

536
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,280
AUDIENCE: Because then you
can push the operator just

537
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,850
through the exponential
of the Hamiltonian.

538
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:05,010
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we'll
see things like that.

539
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,430
We could discuss that
maybe a little later.

540
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,950
But there are some cases,
as we will see immediately,

541
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:16,650
in which some operators are
the same in the two pictures.

542
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:20,700
So basically operators that
commute with the Hamiltonian

543
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:26,320
as you say, since U
involves the Hamiltonian,

544
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,790
and this is the
Hamiltonian, if the operator

545
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:31,310
commutes with the Hamiltonian
and you can move them across,

546
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,268
then they are the same.

547
00:40:32,268 --> 00:40:35,880
So I think it's definitely true.

548
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,640
So we will have an
interesting question,

549
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,450
in fact, whether the
Heisenberg Hamiltonian is

550
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:45,070
equal to the
Schrodinger Hamiltonian,

551
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,290
and we'll answer that very soon.

552
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:52,720
So the one example that here I
think you should keep in mind

553
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,860
is this one.

554
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,900
You know this is true.

555
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,730
So what do you knowing
the Heisenberg picture?

556
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:08,150
That X Heisenberg of t times
P Heisenberg of t commutator

557
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:12,210
is equal to the Heisenberg
version of this.

558
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,000
But here was the unit operator.

559
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,510
And therefore this is just ih
bar times the unit operator

560
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,790
again, because
the units operator

561
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,900
is the same in all pictures.

562
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:31,840
So these commutation relation
is true for any Heisenberg

563
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,950
operator.

564
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,100
Whatever commutation relation
you have of Schrodinger,

565
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,990
it's true for
Heisenberg as well.

566
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,670
OK, so then let's talk
about Hamiltonians.

567
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:53,180
Three, Hamiltonians.

568
00:41:53,180 --> 00:42:00,160
So Heisenberg
Hamiltonian by definition

569
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:07,890
would be equal to U dagger
t 0 Schrodinger Hamiltonian

570
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,980
times U of t 0.

571
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,100
So if the Schrodinger
Hamiltonian-- actually,

572
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:25,490
if Hs at t1 commutes
units with Hs at t2,

573
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:31,270
the Schrodinger Hamiltonian
is such that for all t1 and t2

574
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:34,890
they commute with each other.

575
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:38,560
Remember, if that is the
case, the unitary operator

576
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,790
is any way built
by an exponential.

577
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:43,880
It's this one.

578
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:51,010
And the Schrodinger
Hamiltonians commute.

579
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,770
So as was asked in
the question before,

580
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:57,700
this thing commutes
with that, and you

581
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,180
get that they are the same.

582
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:05,730
So if this is happening, the
two Hamiltonians are identical.

583
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:17,110
And we'll have the
chance to check

584
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:21,220
this today in a nice example.

585
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:29,230
So I will write in this
as saying the Heisenberg

586
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,550
Hamiltonian as a
function of time

587
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:34,580
then is equal to the
Schrodinger Hamiltonian

588
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,160
as a function of time.

589
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:45,160
And this goes Hs of t1
and Hs of t2 commute.

590
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:55,990
OK, now I want you
to notice this thing.

591
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:15,260
Suppose the Hs of t is some
Hs of x,p, and t, for example.

592
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:21,150
OK, now you come and
turn it into Heisenberg

593
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:26,930
by putting a U dagger from the
left and a U from the right.

594
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,560
What will that do?

595
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,360
It will put U dagger from the
left, U dagger on the right.

596
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:36,750
And then it will start
working it's way inside,

597
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:41,990
and any x that it will find
will turn into a Heisenberg x.

598
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,690
Any p will turn
into Heisenberg p.

599
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,160
Imagine, for example,
any Hamiltonian

600
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,630
is some function of x.

601
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,090
It has an x squared.

602
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:53,970
Well the U dagger
and U come and turn

603
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:57,390
this into x Heisenberg squared.

604
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:05,720
So what I claim here happens
is that H Heisenberg of t

605
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:15,540
is equal to U dagger H
Schrodinger of x, p, t, U.

606
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:22,770
And therefore this
becomes H Schrodinger of x

607
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:29,260
Heisenberg of t, P
Heisenberg of t, and t.

608
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:41,550
So here is what the
Heisenberg Hamiltonian is.

609
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:46,040
It's the Schrodinger Hamiltonian
where X's, and P's, or spins

610
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,700
and everything has
become Heisenberg.

611
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:53,300
So the equality of
the two Hamiltonians

612
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:58,110
is a very funny condition on
the Schrodinger Hamiltonian,

613
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:02,010
because this is supposed to
be equal to the Schrodinger

614
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,900
Hamiltonian, which
is of x, p, and t.

615
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:16,420
So you have a function
of x, p, and t.

616
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,430
And you put X
Heisenberg P Heisenberg,

617
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:22,040
and somehow the whole
thing is the same.

618
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:34,470
So this is something very
useful and we'll need it.

619
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:38,170
One more comment,
expectation values.

620
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:41,300
So this is three.

621
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:47,400
Comment number four on
expectation values, which

622
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,220
is something you've already--
it's sort of the way

623
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:57,770
we began the discussion and
wanted to make sure it's clear.

624
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:02,032
So four, expectation values.

625
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:09,670
So we started with this
with alpha and beta,

626
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:12,610
two arbitrary states,
matrix elements.

627
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:17,170
Take them equal and to
be equal to psi of t.

628
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:26,120
So you would have psi
t As psi t is, in fact,

629
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:39,080
equal to psi 0 A
Heisenberg psi 0.

630
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,790
Now that is a key equation.

631
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:47,920
You know you're doing
expectation value at any given

632
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,640
time of a Schrodinger operator,
turn it into Heisenberg

633
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,320
and work at time equals 0.

634
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,170
It simplifies life tremendously.

635
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:00,370
Now this is the key identity.

636
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:03,810
It's the way we motivated
everything in a way.

637
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:08,180
And it's written in
a way that maybe it's

638
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:14,460
a little too schematic,
but we write it this way.

639
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,620
We just say the
expectation value

640
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:23,640
of As is equal to the
expectation value of AH.

641
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,660
And this, well, we
save time like that,

642
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,770
but you have to
know what you mean.

643
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:36,290
When you're computing
the expectation

644
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:37,980
value for a
Schrodinger operator,

645
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,464
you're using time
dependent states.

646
00:48:40,464 --> 00:48:42,005
When you're computing
the expectation

647
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:44,590
value of the
Heisenberg operator,

648
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:48,360
you're using the time equals
0 version of the states,

649
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,680
but they are the same.

650
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,530
So we say that the
Schrodinger expectation value

651
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,680
is equal to the Heisenberg
expectation value.

652
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:01,760
We right it in the bottom,
but we mean the top equation.

653
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,140
And we use it that way.

654
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:12,320
So the Heisenberg
operators, at this moment,

655
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,640
are a little mysterious.

656
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,920
They're supposed to be
given by this formula,

657
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,940
but we've seen that
calculating U can be difficult.

658
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:25,860
So calculating the
Heisenberg operator

659
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:28,010
can be difficult sometimes.

660
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:31,740
So what we try to do
in order to simplify

661
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:35,950
that is find an equation that
is satisfied by the Heisenberg

662
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:40,270
operator, a time
derivative equation.

663
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,170
So let's try to find
an equation that

664
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:47,830
is satisfied by the Heisenberg
operator rather than a formula.

665
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:50,150
You'll say, well,
this is better.

666
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:54,996
But the fact is that seldom you
know U. And even if you know U,

667
00:49:54,996 --> 00:49:59,010
you have to do this
simplification, which is hard.

668
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:03,080
So finding a differential
equation for the operator

669
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,090
is useful.

670
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:11,300
So differential equation
for Heisenberg operators.

671
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:16,300
So what do we want to do?

672
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:28,775
We want to calculate ih bar d
dt of the Heisenberg operator.

673
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:35,710
And so what do we get?

674
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:40,160
Well, we have several things.

675
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,050
Remember, the
Schrodinger operator

676
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:45,160
can have a bit of
time dependence.

677
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,220
The time dependence would be
an explicit time dependence.

678
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:51,360
So let's take the time
derivative of all this.

679
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,680
So you would have three terms.

680
00:50:53,680 --> 00:51:06,670
ih bar dU dagger dt
As U plus U dagger

681
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:21,455
As dU dt plus-- with an ih bar--
U dagger ih bar dAs minus dt.

682
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:40,670
dAs dt and U.

683
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:44,060
Well, you have these equations.

684
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,910
Those were the
Schrodinger equations

685
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:49,100
we started with today.

686
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:53,600
The derivatives of U, or
the derivatives of U dagger.

687
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,790
so what did we have?

688
00:51:56,790 --> 00:52:11,800
Well, we have that ih bar dU dt
was HU-- H Schrodinger times U.

689
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:20,160
And therefore ih
bar dU dagger dt.

690
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,770
I take the dagger of this.

691
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:23,510
I would get a minus sign.

692
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,290
I would put it on
the other side.

693
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:32,310
Is equal to U dagger
Hs with a minus here.

694
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:37,020
And all the U's are
U's of t and t0.

695
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:41,900
I ran out of this thick chalk.

696
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,890
So we'll continue
with thin chalk.

697
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,050
All right, so we are here.

698
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:54,290
We wrote the time
derivative, and we

699
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:58,870
have three terms to work out.

700
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:00,450
So what are they?

701
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:04,000
Well we have this
thing, ih bar this.

702
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:16,060
So let's write it. ih bar d
d dt of As-- of A Heisenberg,

703
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:27,310
I'm sorry-- Is equal to that
term is minus U dagger Hs A

704
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:31,830
Schrodinger U.

705
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:37,940
The next term plus ih
bar dU dt on the right.

706
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:55,840
So we have plus U dagger
As Hs dU dt, so U. Well,

707
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,020
that's not bad.

708
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,250
It's actually quite nice.

709
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:03,830
And then the last term, which
I have very little to say,

710
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:08,600
because in general, this
is a derivative of a time

711
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,370
dependent operator.

712
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:16,470
Partial with respect to time,
it would be 0 if As depends,

713
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:21,160
just say, on X, on P, on
Sx, or any of those things,

714
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,320
has to have a particular t.

715
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:36,800
So I will just leave this as
plus ih bar dAs dt Heisenberg.

716
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,760
The Heisenberg version
of this operator using

717
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,790
the definition that anything,
any operator that we have

718
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:47,880
a U dagger in front,
a U to the right,

719
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,620
is the Heisenberg
version of the operator.

720
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:58,460
So I think I'm doing all
right with this equation.

721
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,850
So what did we have?

722
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:08,230
Here it is. ih bar d dt
of A Heisenberg of t.

723
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:14,850
And now comes the
nice thing, of course.

724
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,670
This thing, look at it.

725
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:21,150
U dagger U. This
turns everything here

726
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:22,460
into Heisenberg.

727
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,170
H Heisenberg, A Heisenberg.

728
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:30,160
Here you have A Heisenberg H
Heisenberg, and what you got

729
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,590
is the commutator between them.

730
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:39,000
So this thing is A Heisenberg
commutator with H Heisenberg.

731
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:46,330
That whole thing.

732
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:54,215
And then you have plus
ih bar dAs dt Heisenberg.

733
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:05,280
So that is the Heisenberg
equation of motion.

734
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:11,640
That is how you can calculate
a Heisenberg operator

735
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,290
if you want.

736
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:18,020
You tried to solve this
differential equation,

737
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,060
and many times
that's the simplest

738
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:23,320
way to calculate the
Heisenberg operator.

739
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,840
So there you go.

740
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,400
It's a pretty
important equation.

741
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:34,390
So let's consider
particular cases immediately

742
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,560
to just get some intuition.

743
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,175
So remarks.

744
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:55,700
Suppose As has no
explicit time dependence.

745
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,765
So basically, there's
no explicit t,

746
00:56:58,765 --> 00:57:02,310
and therefore this
derivative goes away.

747
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:11,090
So the equation becomes
ih bar dAh, of course,

748
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:21,406
dt is equal to Ah
Heisenberg sub h of t.

749
00:57:21,406 --> 00:57:24,150
And you know the
Heisenberg operator

750
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:27,110
is supposed to be simpler.

751
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:27,850
Simple.

752
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:30,730
If the Schrodinger operator
is time independent,

753
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:34,810
it's identical to the
Schrodinger Hamiltonian.

754
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:39,020
Even if the Schrodinger
operator has time dependence,

755
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:43,620
but they commute, this
will become the Schrodinger

756
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:44,470
Hamiltonian.

757
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:46,040
But we can leave it like that.

758
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:50,870
It's a nice thing anyway.

759
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:53,470
Time dependence of
expectation value.

760
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:59,841
So let me do a little remark on
time dependence of expectation

761
00:57:59,841 --> 00:58:00,340
values.

762
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:05,310
So suppose you have the usual
thing that you want to compute.

763
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:11,620
How does the expectation value
of a Schrodinger operator

764
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,880
depend on time?

765
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:20,050
You're faced with that
expectation value of As,

766
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,670
and it changes in
time, and you want

767
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:24,530
to know how you
can compute that.

768
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:30,100
Well, you first say,
OK, ih bar d dt.

769
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:41,960
But this thing is nothing but
psi 0 A Heisenberg of t psi 0.

770
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:46,230
Now I can let the
derivative go in.

771
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:59,690
So this becomes psi 0
ih bar dAh dt psi 0.

772
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:09,335
And using this, assuming that
A is still no time dependence,

773
00:59:09,335 --> 00:59:18,700
A has no explicit
time dependence,

774
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,910
then you can use
just this equation,

775
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:31,935
which give you
psi 0 Ah Hh psi 0.

776
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:38,760
So all in all, what
have you gotten?

777
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:53,100
You've gotten a rather simple
thing, the time derivative

778
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,930
of the expectation values.

779
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:57,900
So ih bar d dt.

780
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,420
And now I write
the left hand side

781
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:06,780
as just expectation value
of H Heisenberg of t.

782
01:00:10,588 --> 01:00:15,330
And on the left hand side has
to the A Schrodinger expectation

783
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:18,360
value, but we call
those expectation values

784
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:22,080
the same thing as a
Heisenberg expectation value.

785
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:30,350
So this thing becomes the right
hand side is the expectation

786
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:37,050
value of A Heisenberg
H Heisenberg like that.

787
01:00:40,354 --> 01:00:47,690
And just the way we say
that Heisenberg expectation

788
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:50,140
values are the same as
Schrodinger expectation values,

789
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:52,760
you could as well
write, if you prefer,

790
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:59,600
as d dt of A Schrodinger
is equal to the expectation

791
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,756
value of A Schrodinger
with H Schrodinger.

792
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:09,720
It's really the same equation.

793
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:14,240
This equation we derived
a couple of lectures ago.

794
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:19,570
And now we know that
the expectation values

795
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:22,450
of Schrodinger operators are
the same as the expectation

796
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:25,050
value of their
Heisenberg counterparts,

797
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:28,890
except that the states are
taking up time equals 0.

798
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:34,590
So you can use either
form of this equation.

799
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:38,590
The bottom one is one
that you've already seen.

800
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:43,340
The top one now looks almost
obvious from the bottom one,

801
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:48,140
but it really took
quite a bit to get it.

802
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,453
One last comment
on these operators.

803
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:56,900
How about conserved operators?

804
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,950
What are those things?

805
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:10,440
A time independent As
is set to be conserved

806
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,400
if it commutes with a
Schrodinger Hamiltonian.

807
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:27,190
If As commutes with As equals 0.

808
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:41,830
Now you know that if As with
Hs is 0, Ah with Hh is 0,

809
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:45,950
because the map between
Heisenberg and Schrodinger

810
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:49,650
pictures is a commutator that
is valued at the Schrodinger

811
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:52,540
picture is valued in the
Heisenberg picture by putting

812
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:53,650
H's.

813
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:58,020
So what you realize from
this is that this thing,

814
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:05,690
this implies Ah
commutes with Hh.

815
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:12,260
And therefore by
point 1, by 1, you

816
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:20,810
have to dAh dt is equal to 0.

817
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:25,150
And this is nice, actually.

818
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:32,530
The Heisenberg operator is
actually time independent.

819
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:34,590
It just doesn't depend on time.

820
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:39,230
So a Schrodinger operator,
it's a funny operator.

821
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:41,020
It doesn't have time in there.

822
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:47,790
It has X's, P's, spins, and
you don't know in general,

823
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:52,530
if it's time independent
in the sense of conserve

824
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:55,430
of expectation values.

825
01:03:55,430 --> 01:04:00,420
But whenever As
commutes with Hs,

826
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:04,740
well, the expectation
values don't change in time.

827
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:08,100
But as you know, this
d dt can be brought in,

828
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:10,740
because the states are
not time dependent.

829
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:14,420
So the fact that this
is 0 means the operator,

830
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:18,810
Heisenberg operator, is
really time independent.

831
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:22,710
Whenever you have a
Schrodinger operator, has no t,

832
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:25,830
the Heisenberg one
can have a lot of t.

833
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:29,460
But if the operator
is conserved,

834
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:33,640
then the Heisenberg operator
will have no t's after all.

835
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:37,260
It will really be conserved.

836
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:42,640
So let's use our last 10
minutes to do an example

837
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,140
and illustrate much of this.

838
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,560
In the notes, there
will be three examples.

839
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:51,860
I will do just one in lecture.

840
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:56,580
You can do the other ones
in recitation next week.

841
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:00,495
There's no need really
that you study these things

842
01:05:00,495 --> 01:05:01,990
at this moment.

843
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:05,410
Just try to get whatever you
can now from the lecture,

844
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:09,840
and next week you'll
go back to this.

845
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:13,050
So the example is the
harmonic oscillator.

846
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:25,130
And it will illustrate the
ideas very nicely, I think.

847
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:28,420
The Schrodinger
Hamiltonian is p squared

848
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:35,400
over 2m plus 1/2 m omega
squared x hat squared.

849
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:41,350
OK, I could put x Schrodinger
and p Schrodinger, but that

850
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:43,880
would be just far
too much. x and p

851
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,380
are the operators
you've always known.

852
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:48,470
They are Schrodinger operators.

853
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:51,980
So we leave them like that.

854
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:57,150
Now I have to write the
Heisenberg Hamiltonian.

855
01:05:57,150 --> 01:06:00,490
Well, what is the
Heisenberg Hamiltonian?

856
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:08,520
yes?

857
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,852
AUDIENCE: It's identical.

858
01:06:09,852 --> 01:06:10,560
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

859
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,140
AUDIENCE: It's identical.

860
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:14,800
PROFESSOR: Identical, yes.

861
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,280
But I will leave that
for a little later.

862
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:21,670
I will just assume,
well, I'm supposed

863
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:26,340
to do U dagger U.
As you said, this

864
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:28,000
is a time independent
Hamiltonian.

865
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,960
It better be the
same, but it will

866
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:35,000
be clearer if we now write
what it should be in general.

867
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,650
Have a U dagger and
a U from the right.

868
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:43,550
They come here, and they turn
this into P Heisenberg over 2m

869
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:47,380
plus 1/2 m omega
squared x Heisenberg.

870
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:55,100
OK, that's your
Heisenberg Hamiltonian.

871
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:58,660
And we will check, in fact,
that it's time independent.

872
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:09,130
So how about the operators X
Heisenberg and P Heisenberg.

873
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:10,810
What are they?

874
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:13,040
Well, I don't know
how to get them,

875
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:16,240
unless I do this
sort of U thing.

876
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:22,170
That doesn't look too bad
but certainly would be messy.

877
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:25,430
You would have to do
an exponential of e

878
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:30,225
to the minus iHt over
t with the x operator

879
01:07:30,225 --> 01:07:31,990
and another exponential.

880
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:34,290
Sounds a little complicated.

881
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:41,150
So let's do it the way the
equations of the Heisenberg

882
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:42,740
operators tell you.

883
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:46,570
Well, X and P are time
independent Schrodinger

884
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:49,950
operators, so that equation
that I boxed holds.

885
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:57,290
So ih dx Heisenberg
dt is nothing else

886
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:02,910
than X Heisenberg commuted
with H Heisenberg.

887
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:05,860
OK, can we do that commutator?

888
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:07,030
Yes.

889
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:09,580
Because X Heisenberg,
as you remember,

890
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:11,670
just commutes with P Heisenberg.

891
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:15,422
So instead of the
Hamiltonian, you can put this.

892
01:08:15,422 --> 01:08:20,720
This is X Heisenberg P
Heisenberg squared over 2m.

893
01:08:27,352 --> 01:08:30,330
OK well, X Heisenberg
P Heisenberg

894
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:34,240
is like you had X and P.
So what is this commutator?

895
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,200
You probably know it by now.

896
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,600
You act with this
and these two p.

897
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,350
So it acts on one, acts on the
other, gives the same on each.

898
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:49,100
So you get P Heisenberg times
the commutator of X and P,

899
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:53,830
which is ih bar
times a factor of 2.

900
01:08:57,250 --> 01:09:00,760
So we could put hats.

901
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,689
Better maybe.

902
01:09:03,689 --> 01:09:05,960
And then what do we get?

903
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,069
The ih there and ih cancels.

904
01:09:09,069 --> 01:09:11,029
And we get some
nice equation that

905
01:09:11,029 --> 01:09:17,960
says dX Heisenberg dt is
1 over m P Heisenberg.

906
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:23,729
Well, it actually
looks like an equation

907
01:09:23,729 --> 01:09:25,310
in classical mechanics.

908
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:28,109
dx dt is P over m.

909
01:09:28,109 --> 01:09:31,529
So that's a good thing about the
Heisenberg equations of motion.

910
01:09:31,529 --> 01:09:34,960
They look like
ordinary equations

911
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,890
for dynamical variables.

912
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:39,560
Well, we've got this one.

913
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:46,479
Let's get P. Well, we didn't
get the operator still,

914
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:49,569
but we got an equation.

915
01:09:49,569 --> 01:09:53,100
So how about P dP dt.

916
01:09:53,100 --> 01:10:03,060
So ih dP Heisenberg dt would be
P Heisenberg with H Heisenberg.

917
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:06,550
And this time only the
potential term in here matters.

918
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:11,090
So it's P Heisenberg
with 1/2 m omega

919
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:14,730
squared X Heisenberg squared.

920
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:15,695
So what do we?

921
01:10:15,695 --> 01:10:20,340
We get 1/2 m omega squared.

922
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:23,870
Then we get again a factor of 2.

923
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:27,420
Then we get one left over Xh.

924
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:33,310
And then a P with Xh,
which is a minus ih bar.

925
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:43,302
So the ih bars cancel, and we
get dPh dt is equal to-- the h

926
01:10:43,302 --> 01:10:48,380
bar cancelled-- m
omega squared Xh.

927
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:49,250
Minus m.

928
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,616
All right, so these are our
Heisenberg equations of motion.

929
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:08,350
So how do we solve for them now?

930
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:12,570
Well, you sort of have
to try the kind of things

931
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:14,690
that you would do classically.

932
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:18,140
Take a second derivative
of this equation.

933
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:29,430
d second Xh dt squared
would be 1 over m dPh dt.

934
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:32,550
And the dPh dt
would be [INAUDIBLE]

935
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:39,530
1 over m times minus
m omega squared Xh.

936
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:50,710
So d second Xh dt squared is
equal to minus omega squared

937
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:55,420
Xh, exactly the
equation of motion

938
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:57,050
of a harmonic oscillator.

939
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:05,060
It's really absolutely
nice that you

940
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:09,350
recover those equations
that you had before,

941
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:14,310
except that now you're
talking operators.

942
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:17,970
And it's going to simplify your
life quite dramatically when

943
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:23,400
you try to use these
operators, because, in a sense,

944
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:28,840
solving for the time
dependent Heisenberg operators

945
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:33,340
is the same as finding the
time evolution of all states.

946
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:35,730
This time the operators
change, and you

947
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:38,020
will know what they change like.

948
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,500
So you have this.

949
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:48,120
And then you write Xh is equal
to A cosine omega t plus B

950
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:54,910
sine omega t where A
and B are some time

951
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:56,560
independent operators.

952
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:04,360
So Xh of t, well,
that's a solution.

953
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,880
How about what is P?

954
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:18,590
Ph of t would be m dX m dx dt.

955
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:31,190
So you get minus m omega
sine omega tA plus m omega

956
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:33,100
cosine omega tB.

957
01:13:38,053 --> 01:13:40,480
OK, so that's it.

958
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,210
That is the most
general solution.

959
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:50,280
But it still doesn't look like
what you would want, does it?

960
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:54,580
No, because you haven't used
the time equals 0 conditions.

961
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:57,430
At time equals 0, the
Heisenberg operators

962
01:13:57,430 --> 01:14:00,310
are identical they to the
Schrodinger operators.

963
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:09,070
So at t equals 0,
Xh of t becomes A,

964
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:15,440
but that must be X hat,
the Schrodinger operator.

965
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:21,630
And at t equals
0, Ph of t becomes

966
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:30,880
equal to this is 0
m omega B. And that

967
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,580
must be equal to
the P hat operator.

968
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:43,220
So actually we have already
now A and B. So B from here

969
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:47,890
is P hat over m omega.

970
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:55,040
And therefore Xh
of t is equal to A,

971
01:14:55,040 --> 01:15:00,370
which is X hat cosine
omega t plus B, which

972
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:06,560
is P hat over m
omega sine omega t.

973
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:12,660
An Ph of t is here.

974
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:23,780
A is-- Ph of t is m omega
B, which is [INAUDIBLE] P.

975
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:33,563
So it's P hat cosine
omega t minus m omega X

976
01:15:33,563 --> 01:15:36,050
hat sine omega t.

977
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,800
So let's see.

978
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,380
I hope I didn't make mistakes.

979
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:50,360
P hat minus m omega
X hat sine omega t.

980
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,000
Yep, this is correct.

981
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:59,400
This is your whole solution
for the Heisenberg operators.

982
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:04,990
So any expectation value
of any power of X and P

983
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:08,630
that you will want to
find its time dependence,

984
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:11,490
just put those
Heisenberg operators,

985
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:15,630
and you will calculate things
with states at time equals 0.

986
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:18,360
It will become very easy.

987
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,760
So the last thing
I want to do is

988
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:26,730
complete the promise
that we had about what

989
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:30,520
is the Heisenberg Hamiltonian.

990
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:34,440
Well, we had the Heisenberg
Hamiltonian there.

991
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:38,300
And now we know the
Heisenberg operators

992
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:43,800
in terms of the Schrodinger one.

993
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:53,630
So Hh of t is equal to
Ph-- 1/2m Ph squared.

994
01:16:53,630 --> 01:17:01,550
So I have P hat cosine omega t
minus m omega X hat sine omega

995
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:15,120
t squared plus 1/2 m
omega squared Xh squared.

996
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:19,940
So X hat cosine
omega t plus P hat

997
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:27,150
over m omega sine
omega t squared.

998
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:30,810
So that's what the
Heisenberg Hamiltonian is.

999
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:36,010
So let's simplify this.

1000
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:37,790
Well, let's square these things.

1001
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:47,310
You have 1/2m cosine squared
omega t P hat squared.

1002
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:50,750
Let's do the square of this one.

1003
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:57,340
You would have
plus 1/2m m squared

1004
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:07,440
omega squared sine
squared omega t X squared.

1005
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,340
And then we have
the cross product,

1006
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:17,465
which would be plus--
or actually minus 1/2m.

1007
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,910
The product of these two things.

1008
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:29,900
m omega sine omega
t cosine omega t.

1009
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:35,670
And you have Px plus XP.

1010
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:45,000
OK, I squared the first terms.

1011
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,410
Now the second one.

1012
01:18:46,410 --> 01:18:49,120
Well, let's square
the P squared here.

1013
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,540
What do we have?

1014
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:57,950
1/2 m omega squared
over m squared

1015
01:18:57,950 --> 01:19:06,120
omega squared sine squared
of omega t P squared.

1016
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:11,740
The x plus 1/2 m
omega squared cosine

1017
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:14,965
squared omega t X squared.

1018
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:20,880
And the cross term.

1019
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:37,990
Plus 1/2 m omega squared over
m omega times cosine omega t

1020
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:42,863
sine omega t XP plus PX.

1021
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:49,740
A little bit of work,
but what do we get?

1022
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:52,330
Well, 1/2 m.

1023
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:56,170
And here we must
have 1/2 m, correct.

1024
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:58,190
1/2 m.

1025
01:19:58,190 --> 01:20:01,040
Sine squared omega t P squared.

1026
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:05,680
So this is equal
1/2 m P squared.

1027
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:14,180
These one's, hall here you
have 1/2 m omega squared.

1028
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:18,440
So it's 1/2 m omega
squared cosine and sine

1029
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:21,930
squared is X hat squared.

1030
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:26,430
And then here we have
all being over 2.

1031
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:30,970
And here omega over 2,
same factors, same factors,

1032
01:20:30,970 --> 01:20:33,350
opposite signs.

1033
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:35,460
Very good.

1034
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,000
Schrodinger Hamiltonian.

1035
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,340
So you confirm that this
theoretical expectation

1036
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:43,350
is absolutely correct.

1037
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:45,100
And what's the meaning?

1038
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:47,900
You have the
Heisenberg Hamiltonian

1039
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:51,000
written in terms of the
Heisenberg variables.

1040
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:57,040
But by the time you substitute
these Heisenberg variables in,

1041
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:01,130
it just becomes identical to
the Schrodinger Hamiltonian.

1042
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:03,530
All right, so that's
all for today.

1043
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:07,420
I hope to see in office
hours in the coming days.

1044
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:13,160
Be here Wednesday 12:30,
maybe 12:25 would be better,

1045
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:16,800
and we'll see you then.

1046
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,350
