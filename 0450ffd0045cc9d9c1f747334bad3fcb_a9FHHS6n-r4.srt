8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,960
PROFESSOR: It's good to be back.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,930
I really want to thank
both Aaron and Will who

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:34,890
took my teaching
duties over last week.

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,340
You've been receiving
updates of the lecture notes,

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,700
and, in particular,
as I don't want

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,980
to go back over
some things, I would

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,980
like you to read some of
the material you have there.

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,500
In particular, the
part on projectors

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,460
has been developed further.

17
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,670
We will meet projectors
a lot in this space,

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,420
because in quantum mechanics,
whenever you do a measurement,

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,392
the effect of a
measurement is to act

20
00:01:11,392 --> 00:01:14,260
on a stage with a projector.

21
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,530
So projectors are
absolutely important.

22
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,920
And orthogonal
projectors are the ones

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,990
that we're going to
use-- are the ones that

24
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,850
are relevant in
quantum mechanics.

25
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,470
There's a property, for
example, of projectors

26
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,250
that is quite neat that is used
in maximization and fitting

27
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:33,990
problems.

28
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,800
And you will see
that in the PSET.

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,820
In the PSET, the
last problem has

30
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,330
to do with using a
projector to find

31
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,750
best approximations to some
functions using polynomials.

32
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,010
So there's lots of things
to say about projectors,

33
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:57,870
and we'll find them along
when we go and do later stuff

34
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,490
in the course.

35
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,820
So please read that
part on projectors.

36
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,490
The other thing is that much
of what we're going to do

37
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:15,740
uses the notation that we have
for describing inner products--

38
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:22,370
for example, u, v. And
then, as we've mentioned,

39
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,250
and this is in the notes--
this, in the bracket notation,

40
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,920
becomes something like this.

41
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,800
And the bracket notation
of quantum mechanics

42
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,610
is fairly nice for
many things, and it's

43
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,560
used sometimes for
some applications.

44
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,150
Everybody uses the bracket
notation for some applications.

45
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,910
I hope to get to
one of those today.

46
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:53,660
So much of the theory
we've developed

47
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,120
is done with this as
the inner product.

48
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,260
Nevertheless, the translation
to the language of bras and kets

49
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,190
is very quick.

50
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,830
So the way the notes are
going to be structured--

51
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,160
and we're still
working on the notes,

52
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,720
and they're going
to chang a bit--

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,670
is that everything
regarding the math

54
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,070
is being developed
more in this notation,

55
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,480
but then we turn
into bras and kets

56
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,490
and just go quickly
over all you've

57
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,130
seen, just how it looks
with bras and kets

58
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,970
so that you're familiar.

59
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,080
Then, in the later
part of the course,

60
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,820
we'll use sometimes bras and
kets, and sometimes this.

61
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,220
And sometimes some
physicisists use

62
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,223
this notation with parentheses.

63
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,560
So for example,
Weinberg's recent book

64
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,735
on quantum mechanics
uses this notation.

65
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:49,905
It doesn't use bras and
kets I think at all.

66
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,890
So you have to be ready
to work with any notation.

67
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,290
The bra and ket notation
has some nice properties

68
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,140
that make it very fast
to do things with it.

69
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,740
It is very efficient.

70
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:12,410
Nevertheless, in some ways this
notation is a little clearer.

71
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,160
So many of the things we'll
develop is with this notation.

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,350
So today I'm going
to develop the idea

73
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,190
of the Hermitian
conjugator for an operator,

74
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,440
or the adjoint of an operator.

75
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:31,630
And this idea is generally a
little subtle, a little hard

76
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,140
to understand.

77
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,200
But we'll just go at it slowly
and try to make it very clear.

78
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:44,100
So adjoints or Hermitian
operators, or Hermitian

79
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:54,260
conjugates-- adjoints
or Hermitian conjugates.

80
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,250
So the idea of Adjoints,
or Hermition conjugates,

81
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:14,220
really begins with some
necessary background

82
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,640
on what they're called--
linear functionals.

83
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,800
It sounds complicated,
but it's not.

84
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,270
What is a linear functional?

85
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:33,440
A linear functional
on V-- on a vector

86
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:44,250
space V-- is a linear
map from V to the numbers

87
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,870
F. We've always been
calling F the numbers.

88
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,060
So it's just that, something
that, once you have a vector,

89
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,120
you get a number
and it's linear.

90
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,900
So a linear function of Phi,
if it's a linear functional,

91
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:11,880
Phi on v belongs to F.
Phi acts on a vector, v,

92
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,720
that belongs to the vector
space and gives you a number.

93
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:25,710
So "linear" means Phi of v1 plus
v2 is Phi of v1 plus Phi of v2.

94
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:33,950
And Phi of av, for a is
number, is a Phi of v.

95
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:39,120
So seems simple,
and indeed it is.

96
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,430
And we can construct examples
of linear functionals,

97
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,515
some trivial ones, for example.

98
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:58,030
Let Phi be a map that takes the
vector space, reals in three

99
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,840
dimensions, to the real numbers.

100
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,950
So how does it act?

101
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:09,000
Phi acts on a vector, which
is x1, x2, and x3-- three

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,190
components.

103
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,680
And it must give
a numbers, so it

104
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,170
could be 3x1 minus x2 plus
7x3, as simple as that.

105
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,480
It's linear.

106
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,560
x1, x2, and x3 are the
coordinates of a single vector.

107
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,780
And whenever you have
this vector, that is,

108
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,530
this triplet-- now, I
could have written it

109
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:42,445
like this-- Phi of x1,
x2, and x3, as a vector.

110
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:43,770
It looks like that.

111
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,600
But it's easier to use
horizontal notation,

112
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,785
so we'll write it like that.

113
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:55,060
And, if you have
an inner product

114
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:01,170
on this space-- on this three
dimensional vector space--

115
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,570
there's something you can say.

116
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,810
Actually this Phi is
equal-- and this we

117
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:15,900
call the vector V-- is
actually equal to u,

118
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:22,020
inner product with v, where u is
the vector that has components

119
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,860
3, minus 1, and
7, because if you

120
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,810
take the inner product of
this vector with this vector,

121
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,659
in three dimensions
real vector spaces--

122
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,380
inner product is a dot product.

123
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,970
And then we make the dot
product of u with the vector V.

124
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,270
Maybe I should have
called it v1, v2, v3.

125
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:53,360
I'll change that--
v1, v2, v3 here

126
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:01,950
are components of the
vector-- v1, v2, and v3,

127
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,190
not to be confused
with three vectors.

128
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:10,890
This whole thing is a vector
V. So this linear functional,

129
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,650
that, given a vector
gives me a number.

130
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,050
The clever thing is
that the inner product

131
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,730
is this thing that gives
you numbers out of vectors.

132
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,100
So you've reconstructed
this linear functional

133
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,120
as the inner product of some
vector with the vector you're

134
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,490
acting on, so, where
u is given by that.

135
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,770
The most important result
about linear functionals

136
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,610
is that this is not an accident.

137
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,190
This kind be that
very generally.

138
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,960
So any time you give
me a linear functional,

139
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,930
I can find a vector that,
using the inner product,

140
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,620
acts on the vector you're
acting on the same way

141
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,480
as the linear function of thus.

142
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,540
The most general
linear functional

143
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,320
is just some most general
vector acting this way.

144
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,800
So let's state
that and prove it.

145
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,190
So this is a theorem, it's
not a definition or anything

146
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,370
like that.

147
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:34,820
Let Phi be a linear
functional on v. Then

148
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:48,800
there is a unique vector u
belonging to the vector space

149
00:10:48,800 --> 00:11:10,370
such that Phi acting
on v is equal to u, v.

150
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,360
Since this is such
a canonical thing,

151
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,490
you could even
invent a notation.

152
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:20,760
Call this the linear
functional created by u,

153
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,250
acting on v. Everybody
doesn't use this,

154
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,860
but you could call it like that.

155
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,870
This is a linear
functional acting on v,

156
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,180
but it's labeled by u, which
is the vector that you've

157
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,900
use there.

158
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:43,210
This is important enough that we
better understand why it works.

159
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,930
So I'll prove it.

160
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,070
We're going to use
an orthonormal basis,

161
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:07,582
say e1 up to en is an
orthonormal, O-N, basis.

162
00:12:07,582 --> 00:12:09,040
AUDIENCE: That
means we're assuming

163
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,532
v is finite dimensional here?

164
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:11,240
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

165
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,656
AUDIENCE: We're assuming V is
finite dimensional, correct?

166
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:18,125
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
finite dimensional

167
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:22,776
I'm going to prove it using
a finite basis like that.

168
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,790
Is true finite dimensional?

169
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,050
I presume yes.

170
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,529
AUDIENCE: If it's
not [INAUDIBLE].

171
00:12:33,813 --> 00:12:34,938
PROFESSOR: What hypothesis?

172
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:37,403
AUDIENCE: You say continuous
when you're talking

173
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:38,890
[INAUDIBLE].

174
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,745
PROFESSOR: OK, I'll check.

175
00:12:41,745 --> 00:12:46,280
But let's just prove this one
finite dimensional like this.

176
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,980
Let's take that.

177
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:57,800
And now write the vector as a
superposition of these vectors.

178
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,900
Now we know how to do that.

179
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:07,560
We just have the components
of v along each basis vector.

180
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,700
For example, the
component of v along e1

181
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,560
is precisely e1, v.
So then you go on

182
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:22,350
like that until
you go en, v, en.

183
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,150
I think you've derived this
a couple of times already,

184
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,920
but this is a statement
you can review,

185
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,410
and let's take it to be correct.

186
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:44,540
Now let's consider what is
Phi acting on a v like that.

187
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,960
Well, it's a linear map, so
it takes on a sum of vectors

188
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,630
by acting on the
vectors, each one.

189
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,970
So it should act on from
this plus that, plus that,

190
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,800
plus that.

191
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,610
Now, it acts on this vector.

192
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,200
Well, this is a number.

193
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,840
The number goes out.

194
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,100
It's a linear function.

195
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:19,190
So this is e1, v, Phi of e1, all
the way up to en, v Phi of en.

196
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:30,320
Now this is a number,
so let's bring it

197
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,060
into the inner product.

198
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,820
Now, if you brought it in
on the side of V as a number

199
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,850
it would go in just
like the number.

200
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,230
If you bring it
into the left side,

201
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,200
remember it's
conjugate homogeneous,

202
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,750
so this enters as
a complex number.

203
00:14:45,750 --> 00:15:05,730
So this would be e1, Phi of
e1 star times V plus en, Phi

204
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:23,240
of en star, v. And then we have
our result that this Phi of v

205
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,050
has been written now.

206
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,690
The left input is different
on each of these terms,

207
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,630
but the right input is the same.

208
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:36,120
So at this moment linearity
on the first input

209
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:46,240
says that you can put here e1,
Phi of e1 star plus up to en,

210
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:57,950
Phi of en star, v. And this
is the vector you were looking

211
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:05,030
for, the vector U. Kind of
simple, at the end of the day

212
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,300
you just used the basis
and made it clearer.

213
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,180
It can always be constructed.

214
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:21,590
Basically, the vector you want
is e1 times Phi of u1 star

215
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,270
plus en up to Phi of en star.

216
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,900
So if you know what the linear
map does to the basis vectors,

217
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,640
you construct the
vector this way.

218
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,780
Vector is done.

219
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,760
The only thing to be
proven is that it's unique.

220
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:43,210
Uniqueness is rather easy
to prove at this stage.

221
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,260
Suppose you know that u
with v works and gives you

222
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,240
the right answer.

223
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,660
Well, you ask, is
there a u prime

224
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,570
that also gives the
right answer for all v?

225
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,970
Well, pass it to the
other side, and you

226
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:04,550
would have u minus u prime,
would have zero inner product

227
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:11,740
with v for all v. Pass
to the other side,

228
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,010
take the difference,
and it's that.

229
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,410
So u minus u prime
is a vector that

230
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,720
has zero inner product
with any vector.

231
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,319
And any such thing
as always zero.

232
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,109
And perhaps the easiest way
to show that, in case you

233
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:30,730
haven't seen that
before, if x with v

234
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:39,053
equals 0 for all for all v.
What can you say about x?

235
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,880
Well, take v is the value
for any v. So take v equal x.

236
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,050
So you take x, x is equal to 0.

237
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,840
And by the axioms of
the inner product,

238
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:59,130
if a vector has 0 inner
product with itself, it's 0.

239
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:04,290
So at this stage, you go
u minus u prime equals 0,

240
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,470
and u is equal to u prime.

241
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,070
So it's definitely
unique, you can't

242
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,755
find another one that works.

243
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,250
So we have this thing.

244
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,875
This theorem is proven.

245
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,220
And now let's use to
define this the adjoint,

246
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,310
which is a very
interesting thing.

247
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:36,700
So the adjoing, or
Hermitian conjugate,

248
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:42,130
sometimes called
adjoint-- physicists

249
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:48,320
use the name Hermitian
conjugate, which

250
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,487
is more appropriate.

251
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:51,320
Well, I don't know if
it's more appropriate.

252
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,260
It's more pictorial if you
have a complex vector space.

253
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,460
And if you're accustomed
with linear algebra

254
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,490
about Hermition matrices,
and what they are,

255
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,085
and that will show
up a little later,

256
00:19:06,085 --> 00:19:10,610
although with a
very curious twist.

257
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:18,170
So given an operator T belonging
to the set of linear operators

258
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:26,950
on a vector space, you
can define T dagger,

259
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:33,730
also belonging to
l of v. So this

260
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,420
is the aim-- constructing an
operator called the Hermitian

261
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,816
conjugate.

262
00:19:40,816 --> 00:19:43,370
Now the way we're
going to do it is

263
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,940
going to be defining
something that is a T star.

264
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,130
Well, I said "T star" because
mathematicians in fact

265
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,810
call it star.

266
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,320
And most mathematicians,
they complex conjugate

267
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,290
if a number is not
z star but z bar.

268
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:03,200
So that's why we
call it T star and I

269
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,060
may make this mistake
a few times today.

270
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,120
We're going to use dagger.

271
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,150
And so I will make
a definition that

272
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,400
will tell you what T
dagger is supposed to be,

273
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,540
acting on things.

274
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,860
But it might not be obvious,
at least at first sight,

275
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,070
that it's a linear operator.

276
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:29,030
So let's see how does this go.

277
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,390
Here is the claim.

278
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:37,590
Consider the
following thing-- u,

279
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:51,380
T, v-- this inner product of
u with T, v. And think of it

280
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,510
as a linear functional.

281
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,820
Well, it's certainly
a linear functional

282
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:05,380
of v. It's a linear
functional because if you

283
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,550
put a times v the a goes out.

284
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,970
And if you put v1 plus
v2 you get it's linear.

285
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,150
So it's linear, but
it's not the usual one's

286
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:20,590
that we've been building, in
which the linear functional

287
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:26,700
looks like u with v. I
just put an operator there.

288
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:36,700
So by this theorem,
there must be some vector

289
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,210
that this can be
represented as this acting

290
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:46,180
with that vector inside here,
because any linear operator is

291
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,400
some vector acting on the
vector-- on the vector

292
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,720
v. Any linear functional, I'm
sorry-- not linear operator.

293
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,940
Any linear functional--
this is a linear functional.

294
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,730
And every linear function can
be written as some vector acting

295
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,430
on v. So there must
be a vector here.

296
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:12,160
Now this vector surely
will depend on what u is.

297
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,760
So we'll give it a name.

298
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:26,260
It's a vector that depends on
U. I'll write it as T dagger u.

299
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:37,360
At this moment, T dagger
is just a map from v

300
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,320
to v. We said that this
thing that we must put here

301
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,860
depends on u, and
it must be a vector.

302
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,310
So it's some thing that
takes u and produces

303
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:54,300
another vector
called T dagger on u.

304
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,440
But we don't know
what T dagger is,

305
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,225
and we don't even
know that it's linear.

306
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,530
So at this moment it's just
a map, and it's a definition.

307
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:13,020
This defines what T dagger
u is, because some vector--

308
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,590
it could be calculated exactly
the same way we calculated

309
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,160
the other ones.

310
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:27,270
So let's try to see
why it is linear.

311
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:38,280
Claim T dagger belongs to
the linear operators in v.

312
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,640
So how do we do that?

313
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,120
Well, we can say the following.

314
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:47,032
Consider u1 plus
u1 acting on Tv.

315
00:23:49,960 --> 00:24:01,700
Well, by definition, this would
be the T dagger of u1 plus u2,

316
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:07,160
some function on u1 plus
u2, because whatever is here

317
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,570
gets acted by T dagger
times v. On the other hand,

318
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:20,970
this thing is equal
to u1, Tv plus u2,

319
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:39,200
Tv, which is equal to T dagger
u1, v plus T dagger u2, v.

320
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:48,700
And, by linearity, here you
get equal to T dagger u1 plus T

321
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,590
dagger on u2.

322
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,680
And then comparing this too--
and this is true for arbitrary

323
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,080
v-- you find that T dagger,
acting on this sum of vectors,

324
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,960
is the same as this thing.

325
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:20,078
And similarly, how about au, Tv?

326
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:41,060
Well, this is equal to T dagger
on au, v. Now, T dagger on au,

327
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,500
do you think the a goes
out as a or as a bar?

328
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,386
Sorry?

329
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:51,110
a or a-bar?

330
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,120
What do you think T dagger
and au is supposed to be?

331
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,730
a, because it's supposed to be
a linear operator, so no dagger

332
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,230
here.

333
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,920
You see-- well, I
didn't show it here.

334
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:11,770
Any linear operator, T on av,
is supposed to be a T of v.

335
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,800
And we're saying
T dagger is also

336
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,360
a linear operator
in the vector space.

337
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,850
So this should be with an a.

338
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,010
We'll see what we get.

339
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:34,010
Well, the a can go out here,
and it becomes a star u1, Tv,

340
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,220
which is equal.

341
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,250
I'm going through the left side.

342
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:43,600
By definition, a
bar T dagger of u,

343
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,470
v. And now the
constant can go in,

344
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:54,330
and it goes back as
a, T dagger u, v. So

345
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:59,100
this must be equal
to that, and you

346
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:07,340
get what we're claiming here,
which is T dagger on au,

347
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,420
is equal to a T dagger of u.

348
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:17,200
So the operator is linear.

349
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:25,720
So we've defined something
this way, and it's linear,

350
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,030
and it's doing all
the right things.

351
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,470
Now, you really feel
proud at this stage.

352
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,470
This is still not
all that intuitive.

353
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,600
What does this all do?

354
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,230
So we're going to do
an example, and we're

355
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:46,710
going to do one more property.

356
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,660
Let me do one more property
and then stop for a second.

357
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:56,220
So here is one property--
ST dagger is supposed to be

358
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,290
T dagger S dagger.

359
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,210
So how do you get that?

360
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,970
Not hard-- u, STv.

361
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:12,300
Well, STv is really the
same as S acting on Tv.

362
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,330
Now the first S can be
brought to the other side

363
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:19,610
by the definition that
you can bring something

364
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,830
to the other side.

365
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,220
Put in a dagger.

366
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,550
So the S is brought
there, and you

367
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:33,060
get S dagger on u, T on v. And
then the T can be brought here

368
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:40,450
and act on this one, and
you get T dagger S dagger u,

369
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:48,670
v. So this thing is the
dagger of this thing,

370
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,230
and that's the statement here.

371
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,540
There's yet one more
simple property,

372
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:09,320
that the dagger of S dagger
is S. You take dagger twice

373
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,550
and you're back to
the same operator.

374
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,570
Nothing has changed.

375
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:17,062
So how do you do that?

376
00:29:17,062 --> 00:29:24,120
Take, for example, this-- take
u, put S dagger here, and put

377
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:33,740
v. Now, by definition,
this is equal to-- you

378
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,000
put the operator on the
other side, adding a dagger.

379
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,655
So that's why we put
that one like this.

380
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:47,540
The operator gets
daggers, so now you've

381
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,410
got the double dagger.

382
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:52,540
So at this moment,
however, you have

383
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:57,170
to do something
to simplify this.

384
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,470
The easiest thing to do is
probably the following--

385
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,760
to just flip these
two, which you

386
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,170
can do the order
by putting a star.

387
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,230
So this is equal.

388
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,155
The left hand side
is equal to this.

389
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:22,406
And now this S dagger can be
moved here and becomes an S.

390
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:32,290
So this is u, Sv, and
you still have the star.

391
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:37,680
And now reverse this by
eliminating the star,

392
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:45,050
so you have S--
I'm sorry, I have

393
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,640
this notation completely wrong.

394
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,600
Sv-- this is u.

395
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,960
The u's v's are easily confused.

396
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,630
So this is v, and this is u.

397
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:08,260
I move the S, and then finally
I have Su, v without a star.

398
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:12,240
I flipped it again.

399
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:19,175
So then you compare these two,
and you get the desired result.

400
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,760
OK, so we've gone
through this thing, which

401
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,252
is the main result
of daggers, and I

402
00:31:30,252 --> 00:31:31,960
would like to see if
there are questions.

403
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,730
Anything that has been unclear
as we've gone along here?

404
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,355
And question?

405
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,316
OK.

406
00:31:48,316 --> 00:31:50,230
No questions.

407
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:59,070
So let's do a simple
example, and it's good

408
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:04,500
because it's useful to
practice with explicit things.

409
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,630
So here's an example.

410
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:16,290
There's a vector space V,
which is three complex numbers,

411
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:19,090
three component vectors--
complex vectors.

412
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:29,706
So a v is equal to v1, v2, v3--
three numbers are all the vi.

413
00:32:29,706 --> 00:32:32,380
Each one belongs to
the complex number.

414
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:37,130
So three complex numbers makes
a vector space like this.

415
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,210
So somebody comes
along and gives you

416
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:47,400
the following linear map--
T on a vector, v1, v1, v3,

417
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,870
gives you another vector.

418
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:49,940
It's a linear map.

419
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,740
So what is it?

420
00:32:51,740 --> 00:33:00,720
It's 0 times v1 plus 2v2 plus
iv3 for the first component.

421
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,780
The first component
of the new vector-- I

422
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:09,450
put the 0v1 just so you see that
it just depends on v2 and v3.

423
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:15,800
The second component is
v1 minus iv2 plus 0v3.

424
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,990
Those are not vectors.

425
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,100
These are components.

426
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,950
These are numbers.

427
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,740
So this is just
a complex number.

428
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,980
This is another complex
number, as it should be.

429
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,090
Acting on three
complex numbers gives

430
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,400
you, linearly, three other ones.

431
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,350
And then the third component--
they don't have space there,

432
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:43,340
so I'll put it here--
3iv1 plus v2 plus 7v3.

433
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,090
And the question
is two questions.

434
00:33:54,090 --> 00:34:06,990
Find T dagger, and write
the matrix representations

435
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,969
of T and T dagger.

436
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:19,830
Write the matrices
T and T dagger

437
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:23,730
using the standard basis
in which the three basis

438
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:33,440
vectors are 1, 0, 0, 0, 1,
1, 0, 0, 1, 0, and 0, 0, 1.

439
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,920
These are the three basis
vectors-- e1, e2, and e3.

440
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,590
You know, to write the matrix
you need the basis vectors.

441
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,300
So that's a problem.

442
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,080
It's a good problem
in order to practice,

443
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,739
to see that you
understand how to turn

444
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,690
an operator into a matrix.

445
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,639
And you don't get confused.

446
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,540
Is it a row?

447
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,540
Is it a column?

448
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,340
How does it go?

449
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,700
So let's do this.

450
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:10,820
So first we're going to try to
find the rules for T dagger.

451
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,230
So we have the following.

452
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,130
You see, you use
the basic property.

453
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:29,312
u on Tv is equal
to T dagger u on v.

454
00:35:29,312 --> 00:35:36,870
So let's try to compute the left
hand side, and then look at it

455
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:41,640
and try to see if we could
derive the right hand side.

456
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,350
So what is u supposed to be
a three component vector?

457
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:53,360
So for that use, u
equals u1, u2, u3.

458
00:35:53,360 --> 00:36:00,520
OK, now implicit in all that is
that when somebody tells you--

459
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,650
OK, you've got a three
dimensional complex vector

460
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,610
space what is the inner product?

461
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,800
The inner product
is complex conjugate

462
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,880
of the first component.

463
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,850
That's first component of the
second, plus complex conjugate

464
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:16,390
of the second times
star, times star.

465
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:19,770
So it's just a generalization
of the dot product,

466
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,865
but you complex conjugate
the first entries.

467
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,080
So what is this?

468
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,430
I should take the complex
conjugate of the first term

469
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:34,350
here-- u1-- times the first one.

470
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:38,940
So I have 2v2 plus iv3.

471
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,660
This is the left hand side,
plus the complex conjugate

472
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,260
of the second
component-- there's

473
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:56,490
the second component--
so u2 times v1 minus iv2

474
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:59,380
plus-- well, 0v3--
his time I won't write

475
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:07,010
it-- plus u3 bar
times the last vector,

476
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:11,710
which is 3iv1 plus v2 plus 7v3.

477
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,450
OK, that's the left hand side.

478
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:24,320
I think I'm going to use
this blackboard here,

479
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,490
because otherwise
the numbers are going

480
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,160
to be hard to see from
one side to the other.

481
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:36,235
So this information,
those two little proofs,

482
00:37:36,235 --> 00:37:36,985
are to be deleted.

483
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:45,190
And now we have
this left hand side.

484
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:49,090
Now, somehow when
you say, OK, now I'm

485
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:54,940
going to try to figure out this
right hand side your head goes

486
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,330
and looks in there
and says well,

487
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:00,250
in the left hand side the
u's are sort of the ones that

488
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:05,000
are alone, and the
v's are acted upon.

489
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,230
Here the v's must be alone.

490
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:12,760
So what I should do
is collect along v.

491
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:20,160
So let's collect along v. So
let's put "something" times v1

492
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,150
plus "something" like v2
plus "something" like v3.

493
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:31,400
And then I will know what
is the vector T star this.

494
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,710
So let's do that.

495
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,530
So v1, let's collect.

496
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:41,750
So you get u2 bar for
this v1, and 3iu3 bar.

497
00:38:46,530 --> 00:39:05,220
v2 will have 2u1 bar
minus iu2 bar plus u3 bar.

498
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,860
I think I got them right.

499
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,430
OK.

500
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:21,840
And then v3, let's collect--
iu1 bar, nothing here,

501
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:28,300
and v3 7u3 bar.

502
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:34,240
OK, and now I must say, OK,
this is the inner product

503
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,320
of T dagger u times v3.

504
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:46,900
So actually, T dagger on
u, which is u1, u2, u3,

505
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:52,980
must be this vector with three
components for which this thing

506
00:39:52,980 --> 00:40:02,120
is the inner product of this
vector with the vector V.

507
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,290
So I look at this
I say, well, what

508
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,600
was the formula for
the inner product?

509
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,960
Well, you complex conjugate
the first entry of this

510
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,840
and multiply by the
first entry of that.

511
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,900
Complex conjugate
the second entry.

512
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:23,970
So here I should
put u2 minus 3iu3,

513
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,940
because the complex
conjugate of that

514
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,340
is that as multiplied by v1.

515
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:35,675
So here I continue--
2u1 plus iu2 plus u3.

516
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:43,680
And, finally,
minus iu1 plus 7u3.

517
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,960
And that's the answer
for this operator.

518
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,990
So the operator
is there for you.

519
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,300
The only thing we haven't
done is the matrices.

520
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:11,180
Let me do a little
piece of one, and you

521
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,710
try to compute the rest.

522
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,890
Make sure you understand it.

523
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:22,190
So suppose you get T
on the basis vector e1.

524
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,980
It's easier than what it looks.

525
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,620
I'm going to have to
write some things in order

526
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,950
to give you a few
components, but then

527
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:32,450
once you get a little practice,
or you look what it means,

528
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:33,670
it will become clear.

529
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,520
So what is T on e1?

530
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,990
Well, it's T on
the vector 1, 0, 0.

531
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:45,750
T on the vector 1, 0, 0-- look
at the top formula ther3--

532
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:50,870
is equal to 0, 1, and 3i.

533
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:02,660
Top formula-- the v1 is
1, and all others are 0.

534
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,995
And this is e2 plus 3ie3.

535
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:14,150
So how do you read,
now, matrix elements?

536
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:20,230
You remember the
formula that T on ei

537
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:27,560
is supposed to be
Tkiek-- sum over k.

538
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:36,770
So this thing is supposed
to be equal to T11e1

539
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:41,840
plus T21e2 plus T31e3.

540
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:51,350
Your sum over the first index,
T of e1, is there for that.

541
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:58,280
So then I read this, and I
see that T21 is equal to 1.

542
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,050
This is equal to 3i.

543
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,580
And this is equal to 0.

544
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,140
So you've got a
piece of the matrix,

545
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:13,140
and the rest I will just
tell you how you see it.

546
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:17,240
But you should check it.

547
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,790
You don't have to write
that much after you

548
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:23,130
have a little
practice with this.

549
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:27,370
But, the matrix T--
what you've learned

550
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,640
is that you have 0, 1, and 3i.

551
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:38,890
So 0, 1, and 3i
are these numbers,

552
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:42,280
in fact-- 0, 1, and 3i.

553
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,460
And they go vertical.

554
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:48,580
So 2, minus i, and 1
is the next column.

555
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,070
2, minus i, and 1
is the next column,

556
00:43:56,070 --> 00:44:00,580
and the third one would be
i-- look at the v3 there.

557
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:06,500
It has an i for the first entry,
a 0 for the second, and a 7.

558
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,620
So this is the matrix.

559
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,360
How about the matrix T dagger?

560
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,470
Same thing-- once you've
done one, don't worry.

561
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:24,370
Don't do the one.

562
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,040
So this you look for
the first column.

563
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,505
It's going to be a 0-- no u1
here-- a 2, and a minus i.

564
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:48,390
0, 2, and a minus i, then 1,
i, and 0, minus 3i, 1, and 7.

565
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:51,190
And those are it.

566
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,150
And look how nice.

567
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,430
The second one is in fact
the Hermitian conjugate

568
00:44:58,430 --> 00:44:59,120
of the other.

569
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,890
Transpose and complex
conjugate gives it to you.

570
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:09,090
So that example suggests
that that, of course,

571
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:11,830
is not an accident.

572
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:14,225
So what do you need
for that to happen?

573
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:21,020
Nobody said that what you're
supposed to do to find T dagger

574
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,260
is transpose some
complex conjugate,

575
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,840
but somehow that's what you
do once you have the matrix,

576
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,550
or at least what
it seems that you

577
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:30,940
do when you have the matrix.

578
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:35,040
So let's see if we can
get that more generally.

579
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,100
So end of example.

580
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:48,170
Look at T dagger u,
v is equal to u, Tv.

581
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:50,230
We know this is
the key equation.

582
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:53,130
Everything comes from this.

583
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:56,650
Now take u and v to be
orthonormal vectors,

584
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:03,930
so u equal ei, and v equal ej.

585
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:05,990
And these are orthonormal.

586
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:08,730
The e's are going to be
orthonormal each time

587
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:12,300
we say basis vectors--
e, orthonormal.

588
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:21,942
So put them here, so you
get T dagger on ei times ej

589
00:46:21,942 --> 00:46:25,810
is equal to ei, Tej.

590
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:36,590
Now use the matrix action
on these operators.

591
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:43,848
So T dagger on ei is
supposed to be T dagger kiek.

592
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,870
The equation is something
worth knowing by heart.

593
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:55,330
What is the matrix
representation?

594
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:58,530
If the index of the
vector goes here,

595
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:00,610
the sum index goes like that.

596
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:06,910
So then you have ej here,
and here you have ei,

597
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,345
and you have Tkjek.

598
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:36,470
So now this basis orthonormal.

599
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:41,570
This is a number, and
this is the basis.

600
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:43,860
The number goes out.

601
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:50,520
T dagger ki-- remember,
it's on the left side,

602
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,540
so it should go out with a star.

603
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:56,970
And then you have ekej.

604
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:00,880
That's orthonormal,
so it's delta kej.

605
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,910
The number here
goes out as well,

606
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:06,220
and the inner product
gives delta ik.

607
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,585
So what do we get?

608
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:24,140
T dagger ji star
is equal to Tij.

609
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:33,495
First, change i for j, so
it looks more familiar.

610
00:48:33,495 --> 00:48:39,500
So then you have T dagger
ij star is equal to Tji.

611
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:46,730
And then take complex
conjugate, so that finally you

612
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:53,843
have T dagger ij is
equal to Tji star.

613
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:04,050
And that shows that, as long as
you have an orthonormal basis

614
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:10,750
you can see the Hermitian
conjugate of the operator

615
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,600
by taking the matrix,
and then what you usually

616
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,730
call the Hermitian
conjugate of the matrix.

617
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:20,360
But I want to
emphasize that, if you

618
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,880
didn't have an
orthonormal basis-- if you

619
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:30,640
have your operator, and you want
to calculate the dagger of it,

620
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,600
and you find its
matrix representation.

621
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,790
You take the Hermitian
conjugate of the matrix.

622
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:41,910
It would be wrong if your basis
vectors are not orthonormal.

623
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:42,880
It just fails.

624
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,050
So what would happen if
the basis vectors are not

625
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,390
orthonormal?

626
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:57,460
Instead of having ei with
ej giving you delta iej,

627
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:02,930
you have that ei with
ej is some number.

628
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:07,830
And you can call it aij, or
alpha iej, or gij, I think,

629
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,510
is maybe a better name.

630
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:21,550
So if the basis is not
orthonormal, then ei with ej

631
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:25,540
is some sort of gij.

632
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,020
And then you go back here.

633
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:36,970
And, instead of having deltas
here, you would have g's.

634
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:48,240
So you would have the T
dagger star ki with gkj

635
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:53,808
is equal to Tkj, gik.

636
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,480
And there's no such
simple thing as saying,

637
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,310
oh, well you just take
the matrix and complex

638
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:06,260
conjugate and transpose.

639
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,250
That's not the dagger.

640
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:11,920
It's more complicated than that.

641
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,180
If this matrix
should be invertible,

642
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,320
you could pass this
to the other side

643
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,590
using the inverse
of this matrix.

644
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:23,450
And you can find a
formula for the dagger

645
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:27,970
in terms of the g matrix, its
inverses and multiplications.

646
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:29,935
So what do you learn from here?

647
00:51:29,935 --> 00:51:35,730
You learn a fundamental
fact, that the statement

648
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:39,010
that an operator-- for
example, you have T.

649
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:43,510
And you can find T
dagger as the adjoint.

650
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:48,360
The adjoint operator, or the
Hermitian conjugate operator,

651
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:52,420
has a basis
independent definition.

652
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:56,350
It just needs that
statement that we've

653
00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:02,050
written many times
now, that T dagger u,

654
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:06,106
v is defined via this relation.

655
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:08,680
And it has nothing
to do with a basis.

656
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,030
It's true for arbitrary vectors.

657
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:14,170
Nevertheless, how you
construct T dagger,

658
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:19,360
if you have a basis--
well, sometimes

659
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,360
it's a Hermitian
conjugate matrix,

660
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,110
if your basis is orthonormal.

661
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:28,700
But that statement, that
the dagger is the Hermitian

662
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:33,090
conjugate basis, is a
little basis dependent,

663
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:38,030
is not a universal
fact about the adjoint.

664
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,330
It's not always
constructed that way.

665
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:44,596
And there will be examples
where you will see that.

666
00:52:44,596 --> 00:52:45,096
Questions?

667
00:52:51,806 --> 00:52:52,802
No questions?

668
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:04,500
Well, let's do brackets
for a few minutes

669
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:08,490
so that you see a few
properties of them.

670
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:13,520
With the same language, I'll
write formulas that we've-- OK,

671
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,190
I wrote a formula here, in fact.

672
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:21,160
So for example,
this formula-- if I

673
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:28,110
want to write it with bras
and kets, I would write u Tv.

674
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:34,360
And I could also
write it as u T v,

675
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:38,620
because remember this
means-- the bra and the ket--

676
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:43,270
just says a way to make clear
that this object is a vector.

677
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:47,060
But this vector is obtained
by acting T on the vector

678
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:52,770
v. So it's T on the vector
v, because a vector v is just

679
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:55,770
something, and when you put
it like that that's still

680
00:53:55,770 --> 00:54:01,850
the vector v. The kit
doesn't do much to it.

681
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:03,670
It's almost like
putting an arrow,

682
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:08,560
so that's why this thing is
really this thing as well.

683
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,500
Now, on the other
hand, this thing--

684
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:19,350
let's say that this is
equal to v, T dagger u star.

685
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:26,295
So then you would put here
that this is v T dagger u star.

686
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:35,230
So this formula is something
that most people remember

687
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:39,750
in physics, written perhaps
a little differently.

688
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:44,460
Change v and u so that
this left hand side now

689
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:52,520
reads u T dagger v.
And it has a star,

690
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:58,780
and the right hand side
would become v T u.

691
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:01,170
And just complex conjugated it.

692
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:16,550
So u T dagger v is equal to v
T u star-- a nice formula that

693
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:22,530
says how do you get to
understand what T dagger is.

694
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:25,870
Well, if you know
T dagger's value

695
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:29,014
in between any set
of states, then you

696
00:55:29,014 --> 00:55:34,300
know-- well, if you know T
between any set of states

697
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,400
u and v, then you
can figure out what

698
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:43,100
T dagger is between any same two
states by using this formula.

699
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,210
What you have to do
is that this thing

700
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,230
is equal to the reverse thing.

701
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:50,600
So you go from right to
left and reverse it here.

702
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,990
So you go v, then T, then
u, and you put a star,

703
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:58,595
and that gives you that object.

704
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,380
Another thing that we've
been doing all the time when

705
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:11,605
we calculate, for
example, ei, T on ej.

706
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,900
What is this?

707
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,050
Well, you know what this is.

708
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:23,160
Let's write it like that-- ei.

709
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:32,368
Now T on ej is
the matrix T kjek.

710
00:56:32,368 --> 00:56:39,460
If this is an orthonormal
basis, here is a delta iek.

711
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:43,930
So this is nothing else but Tij.

712
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:49,200
So another way of writing that
matrix element, ij, of a matrix

713
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:54,840
is to put an ei, an
ej here, and a T here.

714
00:56:54,840 --> 00:57:07,240
So people write it like
that-- Tij is ei comma Tej.

715
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:13,960
Or, in bracket language,
they put ei T ej.

716
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:24,860
So I need it to be
flexible and just

717
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,720
be able to pass from one
notation to the other,

718
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:31,890
because it helps you.

719
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:39,900
One of the most helpful
things in this object

720
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:44,960
is to understand, for example,
in bra and ket notation, what

721
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,070
is the following object?

722
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:52,910
What is ei ei?

723
00:57:57,370 --> 00:58:00,950
This seems like the
wrong kind of thing,

724
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:05,880
because you were supposed to
have bras acting on vectors.

725
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,980
So this would be on
the left of that,

726
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,000
but otherwise it
would be too trivial.

727
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,140
If it would be on the left of
it, it would give you a number.

728
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:18,920
But think of this thing as
a object that stands there.

729
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:23,470
And it's repeated
endlessly, so it's summed.

730
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,680
So what is this object?

731
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,210
Well, this object is a
sum of things like that,

732
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:41,200
so this is really e1 e1 plus e2
e2, and it goes on like that.

733
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:47,310
Well, let it act on a vector.

734
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:50,160
This kind of object
is an operator.

735
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,210
Whenever you have
the bra and the ket

736
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:54,930
sort of in this wrong
position-- the ket first,

737
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:59,210
and the bra afterwards--
this is, in Dirac's notation,

738
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:03,160
an operator, a
particular operator.

739
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,610
And you will see in general
how it is the general operator

740
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:07,660
very soon.

741
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,140
So look at this.

742
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:12,120
You have something like
that, and why do we

743
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,210
call it an operator?

744
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:16,130
We call it an operator
business if it

745
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:19,355
acts on a vector--
you put a vector here,

746
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:23,760
a bra-- this becomes a
number, and there's still

747
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,310
a vector left.

748
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:34,480
So this kind of structure,
acting on something like that,

749
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,660
gives a vector, because
this thing goes in here,

750
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,840
produces a number, and
the vector is left there.

751
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:53,041
So for example, if you act with
this thing on the vector a--

752
00:59:53,041 --> 01:00:00,720
an arbitrary vector
a-- what do you get?

753
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:07,226
Whatever this operator
is is acted on a.

754
01:00:07,226 --> 01:00:12,230
Well, you remember that these
thing are the components of a,

755
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,870
and these are the basis vectors.

756
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:17,795
So this is nothing else
but the vector a again.

757
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:29,530
You see, you can start with
a equals some alpha i's with

758
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:33,540
ei's, and then you calculate
what are the alpha i's.

759
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:41,610
You put an ej a, and this ej
on that gives you alpha j.

760
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:44,430
So alpha j-- these
numbers are nothing else

761
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:47,190
but these things, these numbers.

762
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:51,050
So here you have the
number times the vector.

763
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:55,470
The only difference is that
this is like ei alpha i.

764
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:58,650
The number has
been to the right.

765
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:02,680
So this thing acting on any
vector is the vector itself.

766
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:07,280
So this is perhaps the
most fundamental relation

767
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:15,270
in bracket notation, is that
the identity operator is this.

768
01:01:19,664 --> 01:01:20,163
Yes.

769
01:01:20,163 --> 01:01:23,040
AUDIENCE: Is that just 1 e
of i, or sum over all e of i?

770
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,475
PROFESSOR: It's sum of over all.

771
01:01:24,475 --> 01:01:33,568
So here implicit sum is
the sum of all up to en en.

772
01:01:33,568 --> 01:01:36,430
You will see, if you
take just one of them,

773
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:41,050
you will get what is an
orthogonal projector.

774
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:43,590
Now this allows you
to do another piece

775
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:49,860
of very nice Dirac notation.

776
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:52,005
So let's do that.

777
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:09,610
Suppose you have an
operator T. You put a 1

778
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:15,140
in front of it-- a T
and a 1 in front of it.

779
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:22,070
And then you say, OK,
this 1, I'll put ei ei.

780
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:31,650
Then comes the T, and then
comes the ej ej-- another 1.

781
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,850
And then you look at
that and you suddenly

782
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:40,851
see a number lying there.

783
01:02:40,851 --> 01:02:41,350
Why?

784
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:43,165
Because this thing
is some number.

785
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:47,901
So this is the magic
of the Dirac notation.

786
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:49,650
You write all this
thing, and suddenly you

787
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:53,750
see numbers have been
created in between.

788
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:59,770
This number is nothing else
but this matrix representation

789
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:01,140
of the operator.

790
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:04,550
T, between this, is Tij.

791
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:12,445
So this is ei Tij ej.

792
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:22,610
So this formula is
very fundamental.

793
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:27,210
It shows that the most general
operator that you can ever

794
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:33,770
invent is some sort
of ket before a bra,

795
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:37,470
and then you superimpose
them with these numbers which

796
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:43,280
actually happen to be the matrix
representation of the operator.

797
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,860
So the operator can
be written as a sum

798
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:51,180
of, if this is an n by n matrix
n squared thinks of this form--

799
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:55,300
1 with 1, 1 with 2, 1
with 3, and all of them.

800
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,340
Bu then, you know this
formula is so important

801
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,770
that people make
sure that you realize

802
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:03,420
that you're summing
over i and j.

803
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,190
So just put it there.

804
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:12,730
Given an operator, these
are its matrix elements.

805
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:19,340
And this is the operator written
back in abstract notation.

806
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,370
The whole operator is
back there for you.

807
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:27,440
I want to use the last
part of the lecture

808
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:35,790
to discuss a theorem that
is pretty interesting,

809
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:39,230
that allows you to
understand things

810
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:44,580
about all these Hermitian
operators and unitary operators

811
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,620
much more clearly.

812
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:51,400
And it's a little
mysterious, this theorem,

813
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,720
and let's see how it goes.

814
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:01,650
So any questions about this
Dirac notation at this moment,

815
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:03,730
anything that I wrote there?

816
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,720
It takes a while
to get accustomed

817
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:06,940
to the Dirac notation.

818
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:10,540
But once you get
the hang of it, it's

819
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:13,425
sort of fun and
easy to manipulate.

820
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:17,480
No questions?

821
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,458
Can't be.

822
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:24,670
You can prove all
kinds of things

823
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:29,230
with this matrix
representation of the identity.

824
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:32,140
For example, you
can prove easily

825
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:35,420
something you proved already,
that when you multiply

826
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:39,341
two operators the
matrices multiply.

827
01:05:39,341 --> 01:05:41,120
You can prove all
kinds of things.

828
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,180
Pretty much
everything we've done

829
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:45,530
can also be proven this way.

830
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:49,500
OK, so here comes the theorem
I want to ask you about.

831
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:54,870
Suppose somebody comes
along, and they tell you,

832
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:59,160
well, you know,
here's a vector v,

833
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:04,520
and I'm going to have a linear
operator acting on this space.

834
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:07,300
So the operator's
going to be T, and I'm

835
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:12,770
going act with the vector v.

836
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:15,560
And moreover, I
find that this is

837
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:26,150
0 for all vectors v belonging
to the vector space.

838
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:30,280
And the question is-- what can
we say about this operator?

839
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:39,050
From all vectors it's just 0.

840
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:43,290
So is this operator 0, maybe?

841
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,680
Does it have to be 0?

842
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,245
Can it be something else?

843
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:53,120
OK, we've been talking about
real and complex vector spaces.

844
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,720
And we've seen that
it's different.

845
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,000
The inner product is
a little different.

846
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,410
But let's think about this.

847
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:05,530
Take two dimensions,
real vector space.

848
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:07,760
The operator that
takes any vector

849
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,440
and rotates it by 90 degrees,
that's a linear operator.

850
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:20,570
And that is a non-trivial linear
operator, and it gives you 0.

851
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:26,710
So case settled-- there's
no theorem here, nothing

852
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,500
you can say about this operator.

853
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,140
It may be non-zero.

854
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:33,440
But here comes the catch.

855
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:40,010
If you're talking complex
vector spaces, T is 0.

856
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:42,350
It just is 0, can't
be anything else.

857
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:44,460
Complex vector
spaces are different.

858
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:48,540
You can't quite do that thing--
rotate all vectors by something

859
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:50,420
and do things.

860
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:53,020
So that's a theorem
we want to understand.

861
01:07:53,020 --> 01:08:05,830
Theorem-- let v be a
complex inner product space.

862
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:13,810
By that is a complex vector
space with an inner product.

863
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:25,890
Then v, Tv equals
0 for all v implies

864
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:28,170
that the operator is just 0.

865
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:39,930
I traced a lot of my
confusions in quantum mechanics

866
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:42,390
to not knowing
about this theorem,

867
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:46,109
that somehow it must be true.

868
01:08:46,109 --> 01:08:48,520
I don't know why
it should be true,

869
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:56,250
but somehow it's not, because
it really has exceptions.

870
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:57,300
So here it is.

871
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:01,340
We tried to prove that.

872
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:05,060
It's so important, I think,
that it should be proven.

873
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:08,590
And how could you prove that?

874
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:12,330
And at first sight it seems
it's going to be difficult,

875
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:16,490
because, if I do
just a formal proof,

876
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:18,760
how is it going to
know that I'm not

877
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,069
talking real or
complex vector spaces.

878
01:09:21,069 --> 01:09:24,430
So it must make a crucial
difference in the proof

879
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:27,359
whether it's real or complex.

880
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:31,939
So this property really sets
the complex vector spaces

881
01:09:31,939 --> 01:09:33,970
quite apart from the real ones.

882
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:38,899
So let's see what
you would need to do.

883
01:09:38,899 --> 01:10:01,630
Well, here's a strategy--
if I could prove that u,

884
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:10,800
Tv is equal to 0 for all
u and all v. You see,

885
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,010
the problem here is that
these two are the same vector.

886
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:17,320
They're all vectors, but
they're the same vector.

887
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:23,230
If I could prove that this
is 0 for all u and v, then

888
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:24,380
what would I say?

889
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:27,900
I would say, oh, if this
is 0 for all u and v,

890
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:34,040
then pick u equal to Tv.

891
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:39,410
And then you find
that Tv, Tv is 0,

892
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:43,600
therefore Tv is the 0 vector.

893
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,660
By the axiom of
the inner product,

894
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:50,580
for all v is a 0 vector,
so T kills all vectors,

895
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,630
therefore T is 0.

896
01:10:53,630 --> 01:11:00,060
So if I could prove this
is true, I would be done.

897
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:05,510
Now, of course,
that's the difficulty.

898
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:09,470
Well, I wouldn't say of course.

899
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:13,120
This takes a leap
of faith to believe

900
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:16,060
that this is the way
you're going to prove that.

901
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:20,050
You could try to prove this,
and then it would follow.

902
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:21,890
But maybe that's
difficult to prove.

903
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:24,490
But actually that's
possible to prove.

904
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:28,780
But how could you ever
prove that this is true?

905
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:31,690
You could prove it
if you could somehow

906
01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:40,626
rewrite u and Tv as some
sort of something with a T

907
01:11:40,626 --> 01:11:47,530
and something plus some
other thing with a T,

908
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:52,450
and that other thing plus some--
all kinds of things like that.

909
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:57,100
Because the things in which
this is the same as that are 0.

910
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:03,660
So if you can do that-- if you
could re-express this left hand

911
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:07,840
side as a sum of things of
that kind-- that would be 0.

912
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,700
So let's try.

913
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,840
So what can you try?

914
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:20,490
You can put u plus v here,
and T of u plus v. That

915
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:25,290
would be 0, because that's
a vector, same vector here.

916
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:29,450
But that's not equal to this,
because it has the u, Tu,

917
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:31,650
and it has the v Tv.

918
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:34,130
And it has this in
a different order.

919
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:49,500
So maybe we can subtract u
minus v, T of u minus v. Well,

920
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,400
we're getting
there, but all this

921
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:59,570
is question marks-- u, Tu, v,
Tv-- these cancel-- u, Tu, v,

922
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:01,460
Tv.

923
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,410
But, the cross-products,
what are they?

924
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:06,114
Well here you have a u, Tv.

925
01:13:08,904 --> 01:13:13,210
And here you have a v, Tu.

926
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:16,660
And do they cancel?

927
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:17,630
No.

928
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:18,540
Let's see.

929
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:22,160
u, Tv, and up here
is u minus Tv about.

930
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,000
But there's another minus,
so there's another one there.

931
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,050
And v, Tu has a minus,
minus is a plus.

932
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:32,010
So actually this gives me
two of this plus two of that.

933
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:34,290
OK, it shouldn't have
been so easy anyway.

934
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:43,673
So here is where you have to
have the small inspiration.

935
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:50,170
Somehow it shouldn't
have worked, you know.

936
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:53,860
If this had worked, the
theorem would read different.

937
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:57,240
You could use a
real vector space.

938
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:59,900
Nothing is imaginary there.

939
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:02,600
So the fact that you have
a complex vector space

940
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,290
might help.

941
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:06,150
So somehow you have
to put i's there.

942
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,260
So let's try i's here.

943
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:16,000
So you put u plus iv
and T of u plus iv.

944
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:23,380
Well, then you probably have
to subtract things as well, so

945
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:29,740
u minus iv, T of u minus iv.

946
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:34,030
These things will be 0 because
of the general structure--

947
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:38,020
the same operator here as here.

948
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,620
And let's see what they are.

949
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:43,700
Well, there's u, Tu,
and here's minus u, Tu,

950
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:49,480
so the diagonal things go away--
the minus iv, minus iv, iv,

951
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:53,940
and a T. You have minus
iv, minus iv subtracted,

952
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:55,800
so that also cancels.

953
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,790
So there's the cross-products.

954
01:14:58,790 --> 01:15:05,790
Now you will say, well,
just like the minus signs,

955
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:09,050
you're not going to get
anything because you're

956
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:10,300
going to get 2 and 2.

957
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:13,492
Let's see.

958
01:15:13,492 --> 01:15:15,640
Let's see what we
get with this one.

959
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:23,090
You get u with Tiv,
so you get i u, Tv.

960
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:32,870
But look, this i on the left,
however, when you take it out,

961
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:41,440
becomes a minus i, so
you get minus i v, Tu.

962
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:49,490
And the other
products [INAUDIBLE].

963
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:56,050
So let's look what you get
here-- a u with a minus iv

964
01:15:56,050 --> 01:16:00,366
and a minus here
gives you a 2 here.

965
01:16:00,366 --> 01:16:03,450
And the other
term, v, Tu-- well,

966
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:06,570
this goes out as a plus i.

967
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:11,020
But with a minus, it becomes
a minus i, so v, Tu is this.

968
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:12,185
So there's a 2 here.

969
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:21,500
So that's what these
terms give you.

970
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,700
And now you've succeeded.

971
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:24,220
Why?

972
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:27,110
Because the relative
sign is negative.

973
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:28,830
So who cares?

974
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:32,370
You can divide by i,
and divide this by i.

975
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:34,270
You are constructing something.

976
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:37,070
So let me put here what you get.

977
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:43,695
I can erase this blackboard.

978
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:51,285
So what do we get?

979
01:16:55,860 --> 01:17:03,280
I claim that if you put
one quarter of u plus v,

980
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:15,230
T u plus v minus u minus
v, T of u minus v, then,

981
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:17,680
let's see, what do
we need to keep?

982
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:21,450
We need to keep u and Tv.

983
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:27,250
So divide this by
i plus 1 over i

984
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:36,400
u plus iv, T of
u plus iv minus 1

985
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:42,730
over i, u minus iv,
T of u minus iv.

986
01:17:46,027 --> 01:17:47,490
And close it.

987
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,550
You've divided by i.

988
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:57,180
You get here four of these
ones, zero of these ones,

989
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:00,820
and you got the
answer you wanted.

990
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:04,180
So this whole thing
is written like that,

991
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:11,270
and now, since this
is equal to u with Tv,

992
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:14,170
by the conditions
of the theorem,

993
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:20,500
any vector-- any vector
here-- these are all 0.

994
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:26,000
You've shown that this is 0,
and therefore the operator is 0.

995
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,030
And you should be
very satisfied,

996
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:30,940
because the proof
made use of the fact

997
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:32,840
that it was a
complex vector space.

998
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:36,790
Otherwise you could
not add vectors

999
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:38,250
with an imaginary number.

1000
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:41,880
And the imaginary
number made it all work.

1001
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:45,010
So the theorem is there.

1002
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:48,370
It's a pretty useful
theorem, so let's use it

1003
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:50,940
for the most
obvious application.

1004
01:18:54,890 --> 01:19:01,170
People say that,
whenever you find that v,

1005
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:13,210
Tv is real for all
v, then this operator

1006
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:16,050
is Hermitian, or self-adjoint.

1007
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:23,800
That is, then, it implies
T dagger equals T.

1008
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,950
So let's show that.

1009
01:19:28,590 --> 01:19:32,620
So let's take v, Tv.

1010
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,962
Proof.

1011
01:19:38,962 --> 01:19:48,180
You take v, Tv, and
now this thing is real.

1012
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:55,795
So since this is real, you can
say it's equal to v, Tv star.

1013
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:02,750
Now, because it's real--
that's the assumption.

1014
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:03,990
The number is real.

1015
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:16,520
Now, the star off an
inner product is Tv, v.

1016
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:19,530
But on the other
hand, this operator,

1017
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:24,820
by the definition of
adjoint, can be moved here.

1018
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:30,120
And this is equal
to T dagger v, v. So

1019
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:34,530
now you have done
this is equal to this.

1020
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:37,090
So if you put it
to one side, you

1021
01:20:37,090 --> 01:20:46,510
get that T dagger minus T
on v times v is equal to 0.

1022
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:53,560
Or, since any inner
product that is 00--

1023
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:59,140
it's complex conjugate is
0-- you can write it as v,

1024
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:08,180
T dagger minus v is 0 for all v.

1025
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:11,430
And so this is an actually
well known statement,

1026
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:17,460
that any operator that gives you
real things must be Hermitian.

1027
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:23,110
But it's not obvious, because
that theorem is not obvious.

1028
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:26,660
And now you can use a
theorem and say, well,

1029
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:31,910
since this is true for all
v, T dagger minus T is 0,

1030
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:37,010
and T dagger is equal to T. Then
you can also show, of course,

1031
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:41,730
if T dagger is equal to
T, this thing is real.

1032
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:47,100
So in fact, this
arrow is both ways.

1033
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:53,320
And this way is very easy, but
this way uses this theorem.

1034
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:56,445
There's another
kind of operators

1035
01:21:56,445 --> 01:21:58,630
that are called
unitary operators.

1036
01:21:58,630 --> 01:22:01,060
We'll talk a little more
about them next time.

1037
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:04,940
And they preserve
the norm of vectors.

1038
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:06,480
People define them
from you, and you

1039
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:09,080
see that they preserve
the norm of vectors.

1040
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:11,375
On the other hand, you
sometimes find an operator

1041
01:22:11,375 --> 01:22:14,460
that preserves every norm.

1042
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:16,200
Is it unitary?

1043
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,667
You will say, yes, must be.

1044
01:22:17,667 --> 01:22:18,500
How do you prove it?

1045
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,550
You need again that theorem.

1046
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:23,120
So this theorem is
really quite fundamental

1047
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,950
to understand the
properties of operators.

1048
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:27,750
And we'll continue
that next time.

1049
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,600
All right.
