8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,720
PROFESSOR: What we
have to do today

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:35,080
is study a very important
example of a two- state system.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,090
That will be the
ammonia molecule,

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,555
and will lead us to
understand how masers work.

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,660
Masers are what for
microwaves, the same thing

13
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,450
as lasers are for light-- it's
just a different frequency.

14
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,560
Masers is microwaves
and lasers is for light.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,710
It's the same thing.

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:06,020
So it's a very nice application
of two-state systems.

17
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,560
And then we'll discuss over
the last part of the lecture

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,230
some aspects of nuclear
magnetic resonance.

19
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,600
I don't think I'll
get to the end of it,

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,770
because it's quite
a bit of material.

21
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,040
But we'll try to
see what we can do.

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,410
So let me remind you
of the last thing

23
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,050
we were doing last
time, that this

24
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,220
is going to be in the
backdrop of what we do today.

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,130
We spoke about Hamiltonians
for a two-state system that

26
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,910
were the most general two by
two Hermitian matrix specified

27
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,500
by four real numbers-- g0
and the three components

28
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,510
of the vector g multiplied
by the Pauli matrices.

29
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,460
This is Hermitian.

30
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:57,890
This can be written in this
way, in which we've identified

31
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:05,700
Hamiltonians for spins, in
the sense that g dot sigma--

32
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,169
really, sigma is
proportional to S,

33
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:14,130
so this is equal to
omega dot S, where

34
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:19,430
omega-- Larmor--
is 2g over h bar.

35
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,215
And we explained last time
that if you have a term omega l

36
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:32,130
dot S, spins will rotate
with angular velocity omega l

37
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,420
vector, which means they
rotate around the axis defined

38
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,990
by the vector omega l,
with an angular velocity

39
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,240
equal to the magnitude
of the vector omega l.

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,490
So that's Larmor precession.

41
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:50,390
This Larmor precession in
the case of a magnetic field

42
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,040
is given by minus lambda times
the magnetic field, gamma times

43
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,000
the magnetic field, where gamma
is that constant that relates

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,660
the magnetic moment
of the particle

45
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,250
to the spin angular
momentum of the particle.

46
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,330
Then we got, moreover,
that the energy

47
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,840
levels of this Hamiltonian--
this is a two-state systems,

48
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,930
so it's a two-dimensional
vector space

49
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,780
that can be at most
two energy eigenstates.

50
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,090
That's the simple thing
about two-state systems.

51
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,760
These two energy
eigenstates have

52
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,100
the energies equal
to g0 plus/minus g.

53
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:36,280
And the plus corresponds
to the spin state n plus,

54
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,760
and the minus corresponds
to the spin state n minus.

55
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,600
And you don't have to
talk spin states when

56
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,030
you write this spin
states over here.

57
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,840
The plus, you should think of
spinning in the plus direction,

58
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,840
but the thing that we call
plus is the first basis vector.

59
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,680
And the thing that we call
minus is the second basis vector

60
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,340
of this state space.

61
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,240
Therefore, if you've
given a matrix,

62
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,460
Hamiltonian has nothing
to do with spins.

63
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,100
You still have the notion
that the first basis

64
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,560
vector, whatever it is-- an
iron moving in this direction--

65
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,920
is the mathematical
analog of a spin up.

66
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,720
And the second basis vector--
whatever else it may be--

67
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,210
is the analog of the spin down.

68
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,430
So this will be important
for what we do now,

69
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,270
as we begin the study
of the ammonia molecule,

70
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,170
and its states.

71
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,900
So having reviewed the key
ideas from the last part

72
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,905
of last lecture, are
there any questions?

73
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:08,486
So let me begin with this
ammonia molecule-- double M,

74
00:05:08,486 --> 00:05:12,370
M-O-N-I-A, is NH3.

75
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,340
It's used as a fertilizer.

76
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,820
It's a gas, has strong
odor, no color, fertilizers,

77
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,090
cleaning products,
pharmaceuticals,

78
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,100
all kinds of things.

79
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:37,390
It has the shape of a flattened
tetrahedron with a nitrogen

80
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:43,050
atom at one corner, say, and the
base the three hydrogen atoms.

81
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:48,350
If it would not be a flattened
tetrahedron, this angle

82
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,610
over here-- if it would
be an equilateral, regular

83
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,830
tetrahedron, this
angle over there

84
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,110
would be 60 degrees,
because this every phase

85
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,900
would be an
equilateral triangle.

86
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,520
But if it's a
flattened tetrahedron,

87
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,860
if it will be totally flat--
then n would be at the base.

88
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,380
The angle in between
these two edges

89
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,910
would be 120 degrees, because
they have to add up to 360.

90
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,960
Well, this has 108 degrees,
so it's pretty flat,

91
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,460
this tetrahedron.

92
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,060
And you can imagine, actually,
this is a two-state system,

93
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:34,000
because just as the
nitrogen can be like this--

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,530
can be up with respect to
the base of the hydrogens,

95
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,690
it could also be down.

96
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,940
And so you can imagine
this molecule rotating,

97
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,100
and suddenly the up
nitrogen goes down,

98
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,660
and this keeps rotating--
a possible transition

99
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:01,170
of the system, in
which, well, I don't

100
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,920
know if I'm drawing it well.

101
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,480
I don't think so.

102
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:13,120
But roughly, it could be like
this-- the nitrogen is down.

103
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,390
And this, in principle,
would be like two

104
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,060
possible configurations
of this system.

105
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,570
There's a barrier.

106
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,900
This is in equilibrium,
so if you try to push it,

107
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,810
it's not easy.

108
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,010
But if you did
manage to push it,

109
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,140
it would be stable in
the other direction.

110
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:40,965
It is as if you had a potential
for the nitrogen-- a V of z--

111
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:48,220
the direction is z-- in which
it can be here, up or down.

112
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,330
And it's stable in
either one, but there's

113
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,920
a big barrier in between.

114
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,160
So that's the story
of this nitrogen atom.

115
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,240
And we're going
to try to describe

116
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,140
this as a two-state system.

117
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,200
So I need some notation.

118
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,410
Well, I'm going to
have the first basis

119
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:18,830
state to be called up for N
up, and the second basis state

120
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,800
is going to be called
down for nitrogen down.

121
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:38,390
And now, I'm going
to try to write

122
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,960
the Hamiltonian for this system.

123
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:47,470
Well, you know what
sort of happens here.

124
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,000
Your intuition in quantum
mechanics with wave functions

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,380
should be similar.

126
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,220
Look-- this is not
the two-state system,

127
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,110
because there may be
many energy eigenstates,

128
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,930
but you know that the ground
state looks like a wave

129
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,365
function, just like this.

130
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,050
And the first
excited state could

131
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:25,340
look like a wave function
that is like-- oops-- this.

132
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,720
Pretty much the same
thing, but you flip one,

133
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,200
and if the barrier
is sufficiently high,

134
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,860
these two energy levels
are not that different.

135
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,460
So the question is,
how do we model this?

136
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:45,065
There may be an energy
E0 for the system,

137
00:09:45,065 --> 00:09:48,500
a ground state energy maybe,
and a little bit of a higher

138
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,760
energy.

139
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,885
So we're going to
write the Hamiltonian.

140
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,740
And I'm going to put
E0 for the moment.

141
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,270
And my first basis
state is 1 and up.

142
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,570
This would be the
1 0, and here would

143
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,060
be the 0 1, the
second basis state.

144
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,640
And this is saying
that 1 0, the N up,

145
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,760
is an energy eigenstate
of energy E0.

146
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,290
And down is an energy eigenstate
of energy in up as well.

147
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,140
But that can't be the story.

148
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,660
There cannot be two
degenerate energy eigenstates.

149
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,810
Your intuition tells you
that this is impossible.

150
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,050
One dimensional potential
wouldn't say that.

151
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,750
So there must be
something else happening.

152
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,720
This cannot be the whole
Hamiltonian that describes

153
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,830
the physics of the problem.

154
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,420
So what we're going
to do is try to tinker

155
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,330
with this Hamiltonian,
a simple tinkering that

156
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,080
is going to give us the
physics that we expect.

157
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,680
So I'm going to put a
constant delta here.

158
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,160
This should be Hermitian, so I
should put the delta as well,

159
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,170
another constant there.

160
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,720
For convenience,
however, I'd rather

161
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,300
put the minus sign there.

162
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:25,410
I will define delta to be
positive for definiteness,

163
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:33,950
and for convenience, however,
I will put here minus delta.

164
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:39,840
Now, you could say look,
you say that, but maybe

165
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,050
it's not for convenience.

166
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,500
Maybe it changes the physics.

167
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,130
Well, it cannot
change the physics,

168
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,810
because these things
are the matrix elements

169
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:56,200
of the Hamiltonian-- the 1 2,
and the 2 1 matrix elements.

170
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,370
And I could decide to change
what they call the first basis

171
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,810
vector, to call it minus
the first basis vector.

172
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,810
This would change the sign of
this, change the sign of that,

173
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,000
without changing those signs.

174
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,460
So this sign is a
matter of a basis.

175
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,490
So we certainly have
not made any assumption

176
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,960
by putting that to be a
minus sign over there.

177
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,080
Now, once you have
this Hamiltonian,

178
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,510
this delta is going
to be some energy.

179
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:33,260
And that's going to be what
mimics the physics here,

180
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,720
because these states are not
going to be any more energy

181
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,050
eigenstates.

182
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,700
The matrix is not
diagonal anymore.

183
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,650
So the 1 0 vector,
and the 0 1 vector

184
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,630
are not any more
energy eigenstates.

185
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,420
Moreover, it's
interesting to try

186
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,600
to figure out what it has to
do with our previous system.

187
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:03,090
So this is E0 times 1
minus delta times sigma 1.

188
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,520
And that's a good thing to know.

189
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:18,350
So in this case,
comparing to this g

190
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,180
is the vector in
the x direction,

191
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,590
because its g
multiplying by sigma 1.

192
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:31,410
And it has magnitude delta.

193
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,560
So we notice-- and we're going
to make a picture later--

194
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:43,360
is that g, in this case so
far, is equal to delta times

195
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,000
the unit vector in
the x direction,

196
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,885
minus delta times the unit
vector in the x direction.

197
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,390
So g is equal to delta.

198
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,900
So, OK, we've written those.

199
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,440
Let's then figure out
what are the ground

200
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,650
states and the excited states.

201
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:15,510
And this is a two by two matrix,
and a simple one, at that.

202
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,070
So you could just
do it, or better

203
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,020
to figure out what we're doing.

204
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,090
We'll use our formulas before.

205
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,940
Yes, George.

206
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,860
AUDIENCE: So why is
it that we mandate

207
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,300
that delta has to be real?

208
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,700
I mean, that's not
the most general form.

209
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,190
PROFESSOR: That's right, it's
not the most general form.

210
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,380
So at this moment,
we're trying to do

211
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,860
what any reasonable
physicist does.

212
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,850
Without delta, it doesn't
match the physics.

213
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,330
So let's try the simplest
thing that can work,

214
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,380
and a delta real--
we'll see if it works.

215
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,890
And if it works, we'll worry
later about different things.

216
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:01,290
So we'll put the simplest
thing at this moment,

217
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:06,400
but indeed, we could put
more complicated things.

218
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:13,660
So given this, in fact, we know
what it the energy eigenstates

219
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,180
should be, or we
more or less can

220
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,910
guess what the energy
eigenstates should be.

221
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:26,930
Let me tell you the energies
are g0 plus/minus g,

222
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:36,340
so you're going to get E0
plus delta and e0 minus

223
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:46,180
delta as the energies--
E excited, and E ground.

224
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,490
And the gap between
these two energies--

225
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:55,220
the gap between these two
energy levels is 2 delta.

226
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,840
So there we go.

227
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,540
We've already produced
something good.

228
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,130
We have two energy eigenstates.

229
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,420
There should be a small
energy difference,

230
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,820
and that gap is 2 delta.

231
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,950
Now, what are those states?

232
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:18,750
Well, it's not too hard to
see that the eigenstate that

233
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,980
has this energy is
the excited state, is

234
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:30,500
1 over square root
of 2, 1 minus 1.

235
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,640
If you add with
this matrix on this,

236
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,690
that's the energy eigenstate.

237
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,860
And the energy
eigenstate for this one

238
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:45,460
is 1 over square root of 2, 1 1.

239
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,170
Let's write them.

240
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,900
These are the eigenvectors.

241
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,440
Let's write them as 1
over square root of 2,

242
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:02,310
nitrogen up minus nitrogen down,
and 1 over square root of 2

243
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,430
nitrogen up plus nitrogen down.

244
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:19,839
So I want to, even though it's
not complicated to do this,

245
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,859
and we have called these states
that way, so it's all clear.

246
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:32,260
I want you to see how that comes
from our spin way of thinking.

247
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,000
So you know there's
this molecule,

248
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,060
and for this molecule,
only one direction matters.

249
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,580
We could have called
it x, if we wanted.

250
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,930
In fact, maybe x would
have been a better name.

251
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,080
On the other hand,
for spin states,

252
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,680
there are three
dimensions-- x, y, and z.

253
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,870
So we have to think
in an abstract way.

254
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,780
So where is this vector G?

255
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,870
We said G is minus delta Ex.

256
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,970
So this is the x-axis.

257
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,340
This is the y-axis.

258
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,440
This is the z-axis.

259
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,210
G is here.

260
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,830
The vector G goes
back over here,

261
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:17,000
is minus delta x hat vector.

262
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:29,650
Now, what if you
have g in that way?

263
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:37,210
You know that the
excited state is

264
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,000
one of these states over here.

265
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:47,530
Let's see-- this N plus
is the excited state,

266
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,640
and N minus is the lower state.

267
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,950
So the excited
state should point

268
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:01,120
in the direction of g
vector, because N corresponds

269
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,170
to the direction
of the g vector.

270
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:13,110
G is positive here, this
little g is positive.

271
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,590
So g is in there.

272
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:25,720
N is in there as well,
because g and n are parallel.

273
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,800
And the excited state
should correspond

274
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,970
to N, a vector in
the plus n direction.

275
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,585
So the excited state
should be here.

276
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,870
It's a spin state
in that direction.

277
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,400
That's what that formula says.

278
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,050
And the ground state should
be a spin state in the minus N

279
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:00,500
direction, so this must
be the ground state.

280
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,150
So this I call
the excited state,

281
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:09,410
and this the ground state.

282
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:15,850
And indeed, remember now that
what is your translation.

283
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:20,260
1 and 2-- the 1 and 2 states
are like the plus and minus

284
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,450
of spins.

285
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:29,460
So in terms of spin
language, this excited state

286
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,180
is the plus minus the minus.

287
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:48,190
And this is the plus plus the
minus, because the up is plus,

288
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,810
the down is minus.

289
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:56,380
So indeed, this state--
you probably remember it.

290
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,290
This is a spin along
the x direction.

291
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,710
So the ground state must be like
a spin along the x direction.

292
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,870
That's here.

293
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:10,370
The excited state is a spin, the
orthogonal one in the minus x

294
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,530
direction, so it must be a
state orthogonal to this one,

295
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:18,310
as to this, and it points
in the other direction.

296
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,950
So those are our spins.

297
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,800
And we had that the gap
delta-- the gap is 2 omega.

298
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,100
It's an energy, so
it's what we called

299
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:40,950
h omega naught a photon--
the transition energy.

300
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:45,380
I could give this energy in eVs,
but I actually don't have it.

301
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,880
I have the wavelength of the
frequency of the associated

302
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,500
photon.

303
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,720
So this corresponds
to a frequency

304
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:03,430
nu of 23.87 gigahertz,
and a lambda of about

305
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:09,155
1.26 centimeters-- more
or less half an inch.

306
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:20,980
So that is the
transition difference

307
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,730
between these two levels.

308
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,510
So this is something
people knew--

309
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,280
there's two levels
above this molecule,

310
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,280
and they correspond
to the result

311
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,920
of this perturbation
that splits them.

312
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,970
So in a sense, we've got a nice
model-- perfectly reasonable

313
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,830
model, without introducing
much complexity-- of what

314
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,750
this thing is doing.

315
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,850
So let's do a little exercise.

316
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:56,410
Let's see how does the N
up state evolve in time?

317
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:19,000
So we have psi at time
equals 0 be in the state up.

318
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,350
What is it later?

319
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,210
There are many ways to do
it-- many, many ways to do it.

320
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:33,340
The quickest, in principle,
is to think about spins,

321
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,420
even if just a little painful.

322
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,340
But let's think about spins.

323
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:52,210
Omega l is going to be
around the direction of g.

324
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,645
So think of the
state of the spin.

325
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:03,465
The N up state, the
up state, is here.

326
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:18,340
And then it's going to
precess with angular frequency

327
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,650
vector in the direction of g.

328
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,980
So it's going to precess
in the direction of g.

329
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,090
So you can imagine now
this vector precessing.

330
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:31,310
And it's going to go-- since
it's essentially the minus x

331
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,520
direction-- precession in
time is going to flip it

332
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,040
to the y-axis, and then make
it rotate in the z-y axis.

333
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,430
That's all what
it's going to do.

334
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:45,330
So you have a picture of
what it's going to do.

335
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,950
We might as well calculate a
little, although the picture is

336
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,660
complete, and the frequency
is known, and everything.

337
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,300
But what you do
here, of course, is

338
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,210
you try to write it in
terms of energy eigenstates.

339
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:07,970
And the up state is
the 1 over square root

340
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,035
times the sum of e plus g.

341
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,710
And you know the energies
of those two states,

342
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,580
so you know how
they evolve in time.

343
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,970
It will be in the notes.

344
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,220
You can do this.

345
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:36,130
After you now evolve, with e
to the minus i ht over h bar,

346
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:44,630
you then go back from
e to g, to up and down,

347
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,690
because that's sort of the
intuition that we want to

348
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,850
Have.

349
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:54,570
So it's not difficult.

350
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,000
None of these steps
are difficult.

351
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,190
e and g are written in
terms of up and down.

352
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,060
So what does one get?

353
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:12,130
One gets psi of t is equal e
to the minus i, et over h bar

354
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:18,830
times cosine of t
delta over h bar,

355
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:28,670
times the state up plus i
sine of t delta over h bar,

356
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,625
state down.

357
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,970
This is the time evolution, so
the probabilities, for example,

358
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:53,360
to be up is the square of
this one-- cosine squared

359
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,570
of t delta over h bar.

360
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:02,380
And the probability
to be down is sine

361
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,340
squared of the same thing.

362
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,190
So this poor nitrogen
molecule, if it

363
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,860
happens to have
the nitrogen up, is

364
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,120
going to start
rotating like crazy,

365
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,420
even if you don't do anything.

366
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,740
It's just sitting there, and
it's rotating up and down,

367
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:34,780
with a speed doing this thing
23 billion times a second.

368
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,250
Molecule's up and
down, because it's not

369
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:40,860
in a stationary eigenstate.

370
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,940
Now, here, actually,
you may think

371
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:52,000
that something is a little
funny, because you would say,

372
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,850
well, the frequency of rotation
is like delta over h bar,

373
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:03,440
but the Larmor frequency is
supposed to be 2g over h bar,

374
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,960
so it would correspond to a
Larmor frequency of 2 delta

375
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,196
over h bar, which is exactly
the frequency of the photons.

376
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,140
But there's no
contradiction here.

377
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,940
This is, in fact,
rotating at that speed,

378
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,080
at twice that speed.

379
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,560
Because if you remember,
for a spin state,

380
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:35,550
this was the cosine
of theta over 2.

381
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:39,270
Therefore, as it changes,
that's the way theta over 2

382
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,480
is changing.

383
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,080
But theta, which is the angle
of this physical rotation,

384
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,770
changes twice as fast.

385
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:50,405
So it's, again, those
1/2s of spin states that

386
00:28:50,405 --> 00:28:52,910
are very confusing sometimes.

387
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,040
But there's no contradiction.

388
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,870
The sort of Larmor frequency
of the equivalent spin problem

389
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,800
is exactly the same
as the frequency

390
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,160
of the original problem.

391
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:16,240
So now we want to make this
into something more practical.

392
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,920
And for that, what we
explore is the fact

393
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,255
that this molecule has an
electric dipole moment.

394
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:39,050
So the molecule as
we pictured it there,

395
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,210
as it happens, the
electrons of the hydrogen

396
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,600
sort of cluster
near the nitrogen.

397
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,620
So this up region
is kind of negative.

398
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,190
The bottom region
is kind of positive,

399
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:55,285
and there is an electric
dipole moment pointing down.

400
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,960
So this is a pretty
important property

401
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,720
of this molecule,
this dipole moment.

402
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,380
And electric dipoles
we usually call p.

403
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,800
But for some reason-- maybe
I should change the notes,

404
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,440
at some stage or maybe this
is discussed very nicely

405
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,680
in Feynman's
lectures on physics.

406
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,000
He uses mu for this,
like for magnetic dipole.

407
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,890
So I will actually
use mu as well, now.

408
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:33,300
So this thing has
an electric dipole,

409
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:40,970
and therefore the energy
is the electric dipole

410
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,830
dotted with the electric field.

411
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,210
And that electric field is
an external electric field.

412
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,810
You have this little dipole,
which is this molecule,

413
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,940
and you put it inside
an electric field,

414
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,010
and there's a contribution
to the energy,

415
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:03,220
just because the dipole is
sitting on an electric field.

416
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:08,560
And that means our
Hamiltonian is now changed.

417
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:14,460
So I will consider
the case in which we

418
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,150
have an electric field
in the z direction--

419
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,760
a positive electric field
in the z direction--

420
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:33,620
so that E is equal to E times z.

421
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:40,680
And mu would be equal
to minus mu times z,

422
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,240
because it points down.

423
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,580
We've assumed that
the dipole is down.

424
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:52,870
And the dipole is down
for the case of spin

425
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,740
in the z direction.

426
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:04,420
So look what we get here--
this energy contribution is

427
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,400
essentially mu E. And
it's the energy that

428
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:15,370
is acquired by the state in
which the nitrogen is up.

429
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:19,030
This is for nitrogen up.

430
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,930
So what we've
discovered-- if we want

431
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,890
to model this in the
Hamiltonian is that we can take

432
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:33,150
the Hamiltonian that we
have-- E0 minus delta,

433
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:43,400
e0 minus delta, and the energy
of the state up with nitrogen

434
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,950
up, is this one--
mu E. So we add

435
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:52,030
mu E. And the one
with the spin down

436
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:56,470
will be the opposite, so
it will be minus mu E.

437
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:02,710
And this is our reasonable
expectation for the Hamiltonian

438
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:09,920
of this molecule inside
an electric field.

439
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:15,410
So this is the NH3 in E field.

440
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,630
So again, we can wonder what
kind of thing happens here.

441
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:29,370
And the best thing is to
first say this is E0 1

442
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,730
minus delta sigma 1.

443
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:38,250
And then you see, oh,
it's mu E sigma 3.

444
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,570
So getting to
that, and I realize

445
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,265
this is a little more
painful than the other one.

446
00:33:43,265 --> 00:33:45,840
And we don't have to
do it, because we've

447
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,430
solved the general problem.

448
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,630
And the energies,
this time, are going

449
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:58,340
to be E of the excited one,
and E of the lower one-- ground

450
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,200
state.

451
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,850
It's going to be E0 plus g.

452
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:10,310
And g was the magnitude
of the vector g.

453
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,250
So it's the magnitude
of the vector g

454
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:24,810
that now has components
minus delta 0 and mu E.

455
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:29,570
So here we get plus
square root of delta

456
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:34,080
squared plus mu E squared.

457
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:42,590
And here is 0 minus square
root of delta squared plus mu

458
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,455
E squared.

459
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,802
So there we go.

460
00:34:51,802 --> 00:34:55,090
If we know how the
energies behave,

461
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,030
even if we have some
electric field--

462
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:02,550
and typically delta
is such, and mu

463
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:06,230
is such that, for
most electric fields

464
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,220
that you ever have
in the lab-- this

465
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,330
is very small compared to that.

466
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,740
The dipole moment is
sufficiently small

467
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,710
that the energies
that you get from here

468
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:21,230
are pale compared to the
difference of energies

469
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,580
over there.

470
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,890
So you can approximate.

471
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:34,235
This is E0 plus delta plus
1/2 mu E squared over delta.

472
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,240
This is for mu E small.

473
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:49,410
Here E0 minus delta minus
1/2 mu E over delta squared.

474
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:54,870
And this is when mu E is
much smaller than delta.

475
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,280
Now, the only reason
I point this out

476
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,380
is because it does provide
a technological opportunity

477
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:10,720
to separate a beam of
particles into excited-

478
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,580
and the ground-state level.

479
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,660
Sort of like
Stern-Gerlach experiment,

480
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:23,820
you put, now, this beam that
has this ammonia molecules.

481
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,290
And you put them inside
an electric field

482
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,520
that has a gradient.

483
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,170
In a gradient,
this state is going

484
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,520
to try to go to
minimize its energy.

485
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,680
So it's going to go to the
regions of the electric field

486
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,530
where the electric
field is small.

487
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,290
This particle
minimizes its energy

488
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:48,370
when it goes to the regions
of the electric field

489
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:51,000
when the electric field is big.

490
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,570
So it's like putting it in
a Stern-Gerlach experiment.

491
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,890
You have your beam,
and you separate them.

492
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,470
You have your beam
and you manage

493
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:05,170
to separate the things that
can be in an excited state,

494
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,400
and the things that are
in the ground state.

495
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:17,420
And now what you do is
insert these excited states

496
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,315
into a resonant cavity.

497
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:29,480
Have a little hole here,
and a little hole here,

498
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:35,605
and E comes in, and
something comes out.

499
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:45,930
So we're getting now to
the design of the maser.

500
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:50,050
The idea that we're
trying to do is

501
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:59,670
that we try to
make a cavity tuned

502
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:06,400
to 23.7 gigahertz-- the
frequency associated

503
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,295
with a gap.

504
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:19,610
And we just insert those Es
over there, these excited states

505
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:26,030
over there, and hope that
by the time they go out,

506
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,010
they become a g.

507
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,940
Because if they go from E--
say there was an electric field

508
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,370
here to separate them,
and then E's over here.

509
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,630
This is the excited state.

510
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,830
There's no more electric
fields over here.

511
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:46,590
It just comes into the
cavity as an excited state.

512
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:51,140
The excited state has
energy E0 plus delta.

513
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:57,590
And then, if it manages to go
out of the cavity as the ground

514
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:02,250
state, then it would have
energy E0 minus delta.

515
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:05,390
It must've lost energy to delta.

516
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,360
That can go nicely into
the electromagnetic field

517
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:13,400
and become one photon--
a one photon state

518
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,510
in the cavity of
the right frequency,

519
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:20,130
because the cavity
is tuned to that.

520
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,980
The only difficulty
with this assumption

521
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:28,420
is that E is an
energy eigenstate.

522
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,030
So energy eigenstates are lazy.

523
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,930
They're stationary states.

524
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,980
They don't like to change.

525
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,630
So there's no reason why
it should go out as g.

526
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,650
It's excited state.

527
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,810
It's perfectly happy to
remain excited forever.

528
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:51,210
So what must happen
somehow is that there's

529
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:56,010
an electric field
here in the cavity,

530
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,850
and that stimulates this
thing to make the transition,

531
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:03,370
because once there's
an electric field,

532
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:07,800
E is not anymore an
energy eigenstate.

533
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,400
The E of the original
system is not anymore

534
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,070
an energy eigenstate,
and nor is this.

535
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:16,030
So then it's going
to change in time.

536
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,670
So the problem is a
delicate one in which

537
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:23,960
we want to somehow have
an electric field here

538
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,580
that is self-consistent
with the idea

539
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:32,800
that this excited state goes
out as the ground state.

540
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,530
And that's why it's
microwave amplification

541
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,310
by stimulated
emission of radiation,

542
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,660
because you're going to
amplify a signal here.

543
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,840
It's a microwave, 1
centimeter wavelength--

544
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,610
that's a microwave.

545
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:52,090
And the stimulation is the
fact that this wouldn't do it

546
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:56,200
unless there's some
electric field already.

547
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,880
So you could say, well, so
how does it get started?

548
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,010
There's no electric
field to begin with.

549
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,880
Well, you know
quantum mechanics,

550
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,540
and you know that in general,
there are little fluctuations,

551
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:13,960
and there's energies--
small photons, one

552
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,920
or two photons that suddenly
appear because of anything.

553
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,770
Any motion of charges
in here produces

554
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,570
an electromagnetic wave.

555
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:25,390
So at the beginning, yes--
there's no many photons here.

556
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:30,290
But somehow, by having it
resonate at that frequency,

557
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,310
it's very easy to
get those photons.

558
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:35,540
And a few appear, and a few
molecules start to turn in,

559
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:40,020
and then very soon this is full
with energy, in which there's

560
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,860
a consistent configuration of
some electric field oscillating

561
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:50,360
and producing precisely
the right transitions here.

562
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:56,030
So I want to use the next 50
minutes to describe that math.

563
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,550
How do we do this?

564
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:00,800
Because it just
shows really the sort

565
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,620
of hard part of the problem.

566
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,780
How do you get
consistently a field,

567
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,310
and the radiation going on?

568
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:17,230
So maybe I should call
this E prime and g prime.

569
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,670
They shouldn't be confused.

570
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:23,750
E and g are these states
that we had before.

571
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,840
And E prime and g prime, we
never wrote those states,

572
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,280
but they are deformed states
due to an electric field.

573
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,140
OK, so what do we have to do?

574
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,190
Well here is E and g.

575
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:42,650
And we had a Hamiltonian.

576
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,330
There's going to be an
electric field here,

577
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:49,500
so this Hamiltonian
is the relevant one.

578
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,180
The only problem
with this Hamiltonian

579
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:56,130
is that this is going to be a
time-dependent field, something

580
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,920
that we're a little scared
of-- Hamiltonians with time

581
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,640
dependence-- for good
reason, because they're hard.

582
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,800
But anyway, let's try to see.

583
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,960
Today's all about Hamiltonians
with time dependence.

584
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,220
So there's going to
be a time-dependent

585
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,550
is going to be the wave here.

586
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,330
So that's the
relevant Hamiltonian.

587
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:20,580
But it's the Hamiltonian in the
1 2 basis, in that up nitrogen,

588
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,030
down nitrogen basis.

589
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:27,270
I want that Hamiltonian
in the Eg basis.

590
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:28,230
It's better.

591
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,620
It's more useful.

592
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:38,907
So let's try to see how that
looks-- Hamiltonian in the Eg

593
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:39,406
basis.

594
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:57,860
H prime in E equal 1 g equal
2 primes, maybe put basis.

595
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:07,290
So here is the
Hamiltonian in this basis.

596
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:11,480
In the 1 2 basis, I have to
pass to the other basis, the Eg

597
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,050
basis.

598
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,890
So it's not complicated.

599
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:21,830
It takes a little work, but
it's nothing all that difficult.

600
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:30,000
For example, in the 1 prime h
1 prime, which would be the 1 1

601
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,380
element of this
matrix, I'm supposed

602
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,603
to put here 1 prime is EhE.

603
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:45,000
And now I'm supposed to
say, OK, what is this?

604
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,360
Well, E is 1 over
square root of 2.

605
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:57,390
E was 1 over square
root of 2, 1 minus 1.

606
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:09,450
H is the original H, so it's
E0 plus mu E minus delta minus

607
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:21,220
delta E0 minus mu E. And E
is 1 1, 1 minus 1, again.

608
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,420
And there's also the
square root of 2.

609
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,150
So at the end, this is a 1/2.

610
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:28,880
So this is the kind
of thing you have

611
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,820
to do to pass to this basis.

612
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,590
So I think I'll do
that in the notes.

613
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:37,270
And this calculation is simple.

614
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:39,715
In this case, it
gives E0 plus delta.

615
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:47,383
And in retrospect, that sort
of is pretty reasonable.

616
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:56,700
This is E0 plus delta, and
this is E0 minus delta.

617
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,270
And if you didn't have
an electric field--

618
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:02,960
indeed in this basis,
the first state

619
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,750
is the excited state
who has this energy.

620
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:09,490
The second state is the ground
state, and has this energy.

621
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:12,920
And that makes sense
if there's no mu E.

622
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:18,420
Well, the mu E still shows
up, and it shows up here.

623
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:27,380
So that is the
Hamiltonian in this basis,

624
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,120
and the general
state in this basis

625
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:35,080
is the amplitude to be
excited, and the amplitude

626
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,930
to be in the ground state.

627
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:42,240
This is the general psi of t.

628
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:50,550
So your Schrodinger equation in
this mu basis-- not mu basis,

629
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:59,080
in the Eg basis, you see it's--
Eg basis is the basis of energy

630
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,750
eigenstates if you don't
have electric field.

631
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:03,910
But once you have
an electric field,

632
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:07,220
it's not anymore energy
eigenstates, and much worse

633
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:09,540
if you have a time-dependent
electric field.

634
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:22,570
So the Schrodinger equation
is i h bar d dt of CE Cg

635
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:26,440
is equal to this mu matrix.

636
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,810
And now, E0 is totally
irrelevant for everything.

637
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:33,400
It's a constant of
the unit matrix.

638
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,150
Let's put E0 to 0.

639
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:37,580
There's no need to keep it.

640
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,870
E0 equal zero.

641
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:51,803
So we have delta mu E
minus delta times CECg.

642
00:47:56,550 --> 00:48:02,270
I d dt of psi, h psi--
the Schrodinger equation.

643
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:05,150
Now, the real
difficulty that we have

644
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:09,000
is that E is a function of time.

645
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,210
So this is not all that trivial.

646
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:21,900
So what you do to solve this is
simplify the equation by saying

647
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,960
what would the
solution be if you

648
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,440
didn't have a function of time?

649
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:35,920
Then you would have-- if you
didn't have E, CE Cg of time

650
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:43,250
would be E to the minus i ht.

651
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:48,170
So this would be i delta
t-- the energy of this,

652
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:51,330
if there's no electric
field, the Hamiltonian

653
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:52,960
will be delta minus delta.

654
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,650
So here, I have my
psi ht over h bar.

655
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:00,640
And for the lower
state, you would have E

656
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:06,460
to the plus i delta t
over h bar as solutions,

657
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,930
if you didn't have this.

658
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:12,680
This would be the solutions.

659
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,070
But we want now better.

660
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,060
So what we're going
to say is well,

661
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,810
that's a solution
if I neglect this.

662
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:22,040
So this cannot be
the real solution.

663
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:31,860
So I'll put here beta sub E
of t, and a beta sub g of t.

664
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:38,550
And sure-- if no electric
field, betas are 1.

665
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:40,200
They're not necessary.

666
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,230
But if there is
an electric field,

667
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:44,080
the betas are going
to be complicated,

668
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,320
so we need them there.

669
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:52,180
So this is like an [INAUDIBLE].

670
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:59,230
Now you could plug this back,
and calculate what you get.

671
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,380
And it should not
be too surprising

672
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:07,260
that you're going to get in here
something in which these deltas

673
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:11,330
are going to disappear, because
this thing takes care of that.

674
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:13,850
So there's a little
bit of algebra

675
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:17,760
here, maybe two, three
lines of algebra.

676
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,440
And let me give
you what you get--

677
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:27,030
I h bar d dt of beta E beta g.

678
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:31,100
Now the equation is really
for this quantities--

679
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:37,100
and it's 0 E to the
i omega 0t times mu

680
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:42,220
E, E to the minus
i omega 0t times

681
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:52,710
mu E0, beta E, beta g,
where omega 0 is the Larmor

682
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:57,485
frequency, or 2
delta over h bar.

683
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:06,290
So some calculation
involved, but I

684
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:09,370
hope you don't lose track
of the physics here.

685
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,290
The physics is
that the amplitude

686
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:15,030
to be in E and the
amplitudes to be in g

687
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:23,000
have now been replaced by beta
and beta g, which are expected

688
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,600
to be simpler
things to calculate.

689
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,476
And in fact, since the
probability to be in E

690
00:51:28,476 --> 00:51:31,820
is the norm of to
this thing squared,

691
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:36,940
beta is as good as C to know
how likely is the particle

692
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,910
to be in E, or how
likely is the particle

693
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:41,750
to be in the ground state.

694
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:45,370
You could use beta, because
they differ by a phase.

695
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:49,110
So betas have still the
physical significance

696
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:53,310
of the amplitude
to be in E or g.

697
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,780
And we're still having
an electric field

698
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,950
that is time dependent here.

699
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:03,540
So it's time to put
the time dependence,

700
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:08,810
and what are we going to do?

701
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:13,833
Well we're going to find a sort
of self-consistent operation

702
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:21,070
of this device, in which we will
have an electromagnetic field,

703
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:29,150
E. E of t will be
2 E-- letter E,

704
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:33,460
that now is going to be a
constant with an E0, cosine

705
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:38,240
omega 0 t-- again the Larmor
frequency or the photon

706
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,710
frequency that is emitted
by the possible transition.

707
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:46,510
So we will consider the case
when the cavity has already

708
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:49,620
that electric field
that is going precisely

709
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:55,530
at the right speed
to do things well.

710
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:59,200
So this Et, with the 2
conveniently put here,

711
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:06,990
is equal to E0 E to the i omega
naught t plus e to the minus i

712
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,460
omega naught t.

713
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:18,170
So when you multiply these
things, what do you get?

714
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:21,650
Let me do one of
them for you to see.

715
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:27,690
You get this i--
the top one-- h I'm

716
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,230
going to put to the other side.

717
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:34,980
Beta E is going
to be beta E dot,

718
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:40,710
is going to couple
with this to beta g.

719
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:45,790
So that thing is going to be
this electric field times mu,

720
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:51,530
so mu e0, the h bar
from the left-hand side,

721
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:55,630
and you have E to the i omega
naught t multiplying this,

722
00:53:55,630 --> 00:54:04,520
so it's 1 plus E to the 2i
omega naught t times beta g.

723
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,833
So that's the first equation.

724
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:13,090
Not all that easy, for sure.

725
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:20,520
Second equation--
i beta g dot is

726
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:27,020
equal to mu E0
over h bar, 1 plus

727
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:35,620
e to the minus 2i omega
naught t beta E of t.

728
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:46,400
And now you have to think
maybe a little like engineers,

729
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,860
or physicists, or
mathematicians--

730
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:53,050
whatever you prefer.

731
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,520
But you want to
convince yourself

732
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,410
that what you want
to do is true.

733
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:00,050
And what do you want to do?

734
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:04,290
I like to forget about
these curves, basically.

735
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:08,720
That's what we want to do.

736
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,510
Why would that be true?

737
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:14,900
Well, here's a
reason why it's true.

738
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:19,610
This is a number that sort of
goes between 1 and minus 1,

739
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:21,470
with some phase.

740
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:27,590
Mu E0, however, over h bar,
is a very small number.

741
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:32,010
Mu E0 we're thinking of--
we're saying compared

742
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:40,250
to the natural scales of the
problem, this energy, mu E0,

743
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:43,370
is much smaller than delta.

744
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:50,770
And delta is the thing that is
related to omega naught, which

745
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:56,460
h bar omega naught
is equal to 2 delta.

746
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:05,120
So essentially,
mu E0 is an energy

747
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:09,290
which is very, very slow
compared to h omega naught.

748
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:15,110
Now, being very small,
whatever this is,

749
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:18,390
this time derivative is
going to be very small.

750
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:22,410
So beta E and beta
g are going to be

751
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:27,500
very small-time derivatives--
going to move slowly.

752
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:33,460
If they move slowly over the
time that this oscillates,

753
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,595
this hasn't changed a lot.

754
00:56:35,595 --> 00:56:39,440
And therefore, the average of
this function over that time

755
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,705
is 0, and it doesn't contribute
to the differential equation.

756
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,340
It's actually a good argument.

757
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,300
You can try to
convince yourselves,

758
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,870
or maybe I'll try better
in some way, or something.

759
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:01,350
But it is right.

760
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:05,190
I've tried it, actually,
out with computers

761
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:07,940
and with Mathematica,
and things like that.

762
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,580
And it's really
absolutely true--

763
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:13,450
that if you think of
differential equations

764
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:16,370
as integrals, that you
integrate with this

765
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:19,920
in the right-hand side, you
can see that if this-- really,

766
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,570
the time derivative
is controlled

767
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:25,950
by this, that corresponds
to a frequency much smaller

768
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,280
than omega naught.

769
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,330
These ones don't matter.

770
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:36,420
So it's really interesting,
and still not trivial.

771
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:45,090
But this is a case where we end
up ignoring part of the thing.

772
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:54,430
So what do we get, then? i beta
E dot is equal mu E0 over h bar

773
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:57,400
beta g.

774
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:08,470
And the second equation-- i beta
g dot equal mu E0 over h bar

775
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:13,880
beta E. Therefore, if
you multiply by another i

776
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:20,840
here, and differentiate
i-- i beta double dot of E

777
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:24,670
is equal mu E0 over h bar.

778
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:29,170
The i extra that we
borrowed, the dot here.

779
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:32,090
You can use the second equation.

780
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:42,410
So you get mu E0 over h-bar
squared beta E. Therefore,

781
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:53,150
beta E double dot is equal to
minus mu E0 over h-bar beta E.

782
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:56,580
And you, see your
you're rotating

783
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:09,170
with the a of-- put the
h-bar-- with a frequency

784
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,220
that i much smaller
than omega 0.

785
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:16,740
So this as a frequency,
this is like omega 0.

786
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:23,280
So indeed, the rate of
change of this thing

787
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,660
goes with the frequency
that's much smaller.

788
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:28,760
And it's all right, actually.

789
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:33,230
So, we've had that, and then
we can write the solution,

790
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:35,460
finally.

791
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,510
So, what is it?

792
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:47,180
Beta E of T is cosine
mu E0 t over h-bar.

793
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:57,350
And the probability
to be in the E state

794
00:59:57,350 --> 01:00:02,460
is the square of that
amplitude, so the probability

795
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:07,870
to be in the E state at time
t is the square of that.

796
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:15,690
So it's cos squared
mu E 0 t over h-bar.

797
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:18,640
Again, I'm sorry,
this beta is here,

798
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:23,450
and the probability to
be in the excited state

799
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:26,620
is this square of ce,
but the square of ce

800
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:32,190
is the square of beta E,
so I just square this.

801
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,080
So there you go.

802
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:46,070
We have this thing, and we
now have an understanding

803
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:49,950
of how this goes
as time goes by.

804
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:58,030
In fact, this mu e 0 T or
h-bar under bar goes by.

805
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,900
This starts to as
a cosine squared,

806
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,680
and then it goes like this.

807
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:06,370
And this is the place when
this is equal to pi over 2.

808
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,490
So, what do we need?

809
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:19,350
We need the place
where this happens--

810
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:28,490
we can call that time T-- be
such that mu E 0 T over h-bar

811
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:35,360
be equal to pi over
2, or 3 pi over 2.

812
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:41,210
For those values of time,
the probability to be excited

813
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:45,380
is zero, and therefore you
must be in the ground state.

814
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:51,830
These two probabilities
squared added go to 1.

815
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:57,460
So you're either E or G. So if
you have zero probability to be

816
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:06,580
in E, you will be
in the state G.

817
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:11,250
So, the whole issue is
basically at this moment

818
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:15,900
that you must give
the right speed,

819
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,830
or for a given the
speed of the molecules,

820
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:23,340
there will be a time that
it takes to traverse.

821
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:28,140
That time is related
to the steady state

822
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:33,990
value of this electric
field by this relation.

823
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:37,960
So you need the right
velocity-- the molecules have

824
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,950
to be at the right
temperature, that's

825
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:44,450
when they'll have a velocity--
so that they travel in such

826
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:46,980
a way that is
consistent with this.

827
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:54,370
As they do that, each of these
particles that goes from E to G

828
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:57,400
gives out one
photon, one quantum

829
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,090
of the electromagnetic
field, and helps

830
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:03,580
build the time
dependent electric field

831
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:06,990
that we started
at the beginning.

832
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:12,730
Now if you, at some point for
some speed of the molecules,

833
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:15,790
you saturate this and you
build some electric field,

834
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:21,600
and then you have your cavity
operating at the nominal way.

835
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,410
And then, of course, you want
to use this for something,

836
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:29,260
so you shine, let it go out,
and shine those microwaves

837
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:30,660
or do something.

838
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,560
And if you want to
recharge it, you

839
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:36,870
keep adding nitrogen molecules.

840
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:40,280
Now, this was a great
discovery, actually.

841
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,590
Charles Townes,
Gordon, and Zeiger,

842
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:46,750
built this ammonia
maser in 1953.

843
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:50,110
They got the Nobel Prize.

844
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:55,450
Nobel Prize, Charles
Townes got it in 1964.

845
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:57,500
And he emphasized
that this masers

846
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,830
do the most perfect
amplification

847
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:04,280
consistent with the
uncertainty principle.

848
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,040
This is a coherent state of
flight that is built here,

849
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:11,560
and it's much better than any
vacuum amplifier or anything

850
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:14,730
like that, because the
thing that this giving out

851
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:18,980
those photons is a molecule
that this uncharged.

852
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,680
So it doesn't disturb
the electromagnetic field

853
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,290
in the cavity as
it goes through.

854
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:28,170
Many times you use an
electron, for example,

855
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:30,000
to give out some energy.

856
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,800
But the electron
itself is charged,

857
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,640
so it produces additional
electromagnetic fields,

858
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,630
shot noise, all kinds of noise.

859
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:40,610
This is absolutely
quiet device in which

860
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:46,990
is this turns from one state
to another smoothly, stimulated

861
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:50,080
by the electric field, because
if there was no electric field

862
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:54,460
would be an energy eigenstate
and then it gives out photon

863
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:57,170
after photon.

864
01:04:57,170 --> 01:05:04,660
So the uncertainties actually,
in this noble lecture,

865
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:07,830
which is fun to
read-- in fact, you

866
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:12,730
remember delta N
delta phi supposed

867
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:15,400
to be greater than 1/2.

868
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,150
Well, for coherent states as
we more or less discussed,

869
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:22,480
this thing is saturated.

870
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,980
And what do you have now?

871
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:26,900
You have a coherent
state of light.

872
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:29,430
You may remember
that the expectation

873
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:34,850
value of N in a coherent
state alpha was alpha squared.

874
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:40,430
And you call this the
number n of photons.

875
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:47,100
And the uncertainty in
N was, in fact, alpha.

876
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,070
So, it's square root of n.

877
01:05:52,580 --> 01:06:01,830
So for this thing,
we have the situation

878
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:07,720
in which we are working
with a coherent state that

879
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,750
saturates this.

880
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:17,900
So delta n times delta
phi is about one half.

881
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:21,810
And delta n is square root
of the number of photons.

882
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:26,310
So delta phi is about
to 1 over 2 square root

883
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:27,686
of the number of photons.

884
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,160
And you can imagine
the cavity easily

885
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,680
can have 10 to the 12
photons, and to 15 photons.

886
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,020
Something fairly big.

887
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:45,580
And you get an
uncertainty phase.

888
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:48,340
The thing is coherent.

889
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:50,800
All the pieces of that
electromagnetic wave,

890
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:55,700
the phases are very coherent
up to an incredibly great

891
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:58,550
accuracy.

892
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:03,410
So it's a great discovery and
the beginning of many things

893
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:07,480
that were done here, in fact,
by Professor Kleppner and others

894
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,480
in the '60s with
other type of lasers

895
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,130
and masers and this whole thing.

896
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:16,910
So, that's pretty
much what's I wanted

897
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:19,580
to say about the ammonia
and these things,

898
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:21,550
and we're going
to use the last 15

899
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:25,570
minutes to begin
something else, NMR.

900
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:30,040
And, so are there any
questions so this Point?

901
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,946
Yes?

902
01:07:31,946 --> 01:07:32,862
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

903
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,910
If it started changing
between states,

904
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:41,389
I sort of imagine a photon
being omitted and absorbed,

905
01:07:41,389 --> 01:07:44,868
what exactly is happening
then? [INAUDIBLE]?

906
01:07:44,868 --> 01:07:47,850
I just happened to catch
it in the right moment.

907
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:50,310
PROFESSOR: Well, in this
case, it's basically

908
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:55,310
omitted all the time, because
we've tuned the cavity in such

909
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:59,930
a way that if it comes
as E, goes out as G.

910
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:03,540
So the whole process by
the time that it entered

911
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:07,050
and it went out, it has to
have omitted one photon.

912
01:08:10,092 --> 01:08:11,675
AUDIENCE: In the
midst of the process,

913
01:08:11,675 --> 01:08:13,830
how does it get back
somehow, because it's

914
01:08:13,830 --> 01:08:15,920
sort of oscillating
between states.

915
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,800
PROFESSOR: It
doesn't get it back.

916
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:21,660
If the cavity would be
badly designed in such a way

917
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:26,710
that it may be twice as long,
it would out still come as E.

918
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:29,090
So it would make
the one transition

919
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:31,319
and then absorb
another thing, it

920
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:33,684
would just not
generate anything.

921
01:08:33,684 --> 01:08:34,600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

922
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,266
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

923
01:08:35,266 --> 01:08:36,279
AUDIENCE: Interesting.

924
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:40,990
PROFESSOR: And you know,
a more complete discussion

925
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:46,410
of this, of course, if you
really want to do everything,

926
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:49,689
you would have to treat
the photon states.

927
01:08:49,689 --> 01:08:53,970
Here, we treated this
as a wave coupled

928
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:57,620
to the quantum system
of the molecule.

929
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:01,810
You could treat the photons
themselves as quanta

930
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:04,790
and do quantum mechanics of
the photon field on that.

931
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:08,210
And that would be a wave that
you could calculate things more

932
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,529
completely .

933
01:09:09,529 --> 01:09:12,960
But this is not what we do now.

934
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,520
Any other questions?

935
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,170
Yes?

936
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:18,104
AUDIENCE: So physically, are
the nitrogen molecules all

937
01:09:18,104 --> 01:09:21,038
fixed in the same orientation
going in to this device?

938
01:09:21,038 --> 01:09:22,029
How does that happen?

939
01:09:22,029 --> 01:09:23,184
PROFESSOR: Are the what?

940
01:09:23,184 --> 01:09:25,600
AUDIENCE: The molecules all
fixed in the same orientation?

941
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:26,250
PROFESSOR: Yes.

942
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:30,229
Essentially it's not
quite like an orientation.

943
01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:31,530
It's an energy eigenstate.

944
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:37,430
So basically what
you have to do is

945
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:41,270
have this beam of
ammonia molecules

946
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:44,399
and do this beam splitter
that we talked about

947
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:45,399
with the electric field.

948
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:49,399
And you split the beam into
some that are all excited,

949
01:09:49,399 --> 01:09:51,170
and some that are ground.

950
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:52,670
And that's it.

951
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:57,063
You need that everything that
enters here is excited state.

952
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,140
OK.

953
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:05,280
So another time
dependent problem

954
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:09,890
that we're going to discuss
today and continue next time

955
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:15,920
is the NMR problem,
nuclear magnetic resonance.

956
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,425
So this is a pretty
interesting problem.

957
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,295
Our nuclear magnetic resonance.

958
01:10:23,295 --> 01:10:28,550
And it all begins by having
a magnetic field that

959
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:33,640
has a big component
here, B0, I think.

960
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,120
It's a good name for it.

961
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:45,770
B0 Z, indeed.

962
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:51,960
And then you're going to
have some magnetic field that

963
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:58,720
is going to be rotating here
in time, in the xy plane.

964
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,570
We'll assume that time
equals 0, is here,

965
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:05,860
and then it's rotating with
some angular frequency omega.

966
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:11,680
So the total magnetic
field is B0 Z hat

967
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:18,580
plus some number, B 1--
I'll write it here--

968
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:29,560
plus B 1 cosine omega t times
x hat minus sine omega t times

969
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,936
y hat.

970
01:11:31,936 --> 01:11:39,170
So, indeed, in the xy
plane, seen like this,

971
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:43,280
you have it here and it's
rotating with angular frequency

972
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,820
omega this way, clockwise.

973
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,050
All right.

974
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:51,540
So we have this magnetic field.

975
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,500
And of course we're going
to try to figure out

976
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,670
what spins do in it.

977
01:11:56,670 --> 01:12:00,170
And the magnetic field
is time dependent.

978
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:06,710
So we're in risk of getting
a time dependent Hamiltonian.

979
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:08,590
So what is the Hamiltonian?

980
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:11,520
This possibly time
dependent, it's

981
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:17,520
supposed to be minus
gamma B times the spin.

982
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,160
So what is that?

983
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:38,410
It's minus gamma B0 Sz--
The z component matches

984
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:48,040
with the z component of the
spin-- plus B1, Sx cosine omega

985
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:52,520
t minus Sy sine omega t.

986
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:04,050
And, well, it's as bad as you
could imagine, pretty much.

987
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:07,460
This Hamiltonian
is time dependent.

988
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:11,170
And there's some good news if
even if it's time dependent,

989
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:13,210
they commute at different times.

990
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:15,620
The time evolution is EC.

991
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:18,590
But no, they don't commute
at different times.

992
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:25,290
Time equal 0, for example,
you have Sz and Sx,

993
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:28,800
but at a later time,
you will have Sz and Sy,

994
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,840
and they just don't commute.

995
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:38,610
So we have no cookbook
recipe to solve this problem.

996
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:42,560
We have to figure it out.

997
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,490
And there are several
ways to figure it out.

998
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:48,590
I had a way to figure
it out that I explained

999
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:53,760
in previous years, but
today I suddenly thought

1000
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,670
I could explain it in a
different way that is maybe

1001
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:02,300
a little harder
conceptually, but explains

1002
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,950
more of what's going on.

1003
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:09,070
So this is what I
want to try to do now.

1004
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:13,130
And basically what
we're going to try to do

1005
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:19,560
is get the main intuition
going for this problem.

1006
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,480
I have the Schrodinger
equation for this problem that

1007
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:26,810
is very complicated with a
time dependent Hamiltonian.

1008
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:31,210
So if you have a wave
function-- and now

1009
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:33,740
I'm going to be a little
rough for a little while.

1010
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:37,365
A h-bar D T H psi.

1011
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:42,300
And it-- oops.

1012
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:44,700
What is it?

1013
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:52,515
Let's see which lights--
Lights, general.

1014
01:14:52,515 --> 01:14:53,015
OK.

1015
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:01,620
So if you have a problem
like this, you might say,

1016
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:06,390
well, I would like to do
something non-trivial to this,

1017
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:10,770
so I want to maybe
change the Hamiltonian

1018
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:13,760
and do the same
physical problem.

1019
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:18,090
Now that's not easy, because if
it's the same physical problem,

1020
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:21,400
how can you change the
Hamiltonian all that much?

1021
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,940
So one thing you
could do is you can

1022
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:30,910
try to change the states by
doing a unitary transformation,

1023
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:35,910
and then hope that the
unitary transformation acts

1024
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:37,960
on this Hamiltonian.

1025
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,525
So this will be the new states.

1026
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:45,650
And you would hope that
this unitary transformation

1027
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:48,590
would somehow, working
with these new states,

1028
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:51,510
would simplify the Hamiltonian.

1029
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:53,950
But unitary
transformations in general

1030
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:56,800
is just like a change of bases.

1031
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,560
It's not going to
do all that much,

1032
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,940
unless the unitary
transformation has

1033
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:08,360
time dependence, in which
case it doesn't just

1034
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:13,420
rotate the Hamiltonian
but messes up this term.

1035
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:18,420
But this is really your only
possibility of fixing things,

1036
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:24,050
is to try to do a time
independent unitary

1037
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:27,450
transformation that somehow
you started with a spin

1038
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:31,770
Hamiltonian, and you're going
to do a unitary transformation,

1039
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:37,280
and perhaps it's going to
be a time independent one.

1040
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:41,230
But this U is going
to depend on time.

1041
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:43,660
And this is not the
whole Hamiltonian,

1042
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:46,180
because there's a
problem with this part.

1043
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:50,240
So the idea is sort
of vague, but you're

1044
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:54,210
getting a little of the
gist of what we try to do.

1045
01:16:54,210 --> 01:17:01,860
So the first thing I tried to
do is something maybe intuitive

1046
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:05,860
about though this system.

1047
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:18,870
I could say that suppose
I have a system here,

1048
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:21,870
and the Hamiltonian is 0.

1049
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:22,780
Nothing.

1050
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:26,060
Nothing happens in that system.

1051
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:29,500
Now the thing that this
curious about this,

1052
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:32,390
that this magnetic
field is rotating.

1053
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:36,910
So let's try to imagine
how would physics

1054
01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:43,450
look if you have the xy axis,
and you have the xy axis

1055
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:49,400
rotating with angular
velocity omega.

1056
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:53,820
So the xy in the plane is
rotating with angular velocity

1057
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:54,610
omega.

1058
01:17:54,610 --> 01:17:56,730
What would happen?

1059
01:17:56,730 --> 01:18:01,890
So there's an Hs
that is originally 0.

1060
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:06,480
You say it's 0, and any
spin state stays there.

1061
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:07,970
There's no time evolution.

1062
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:09,940
H is equal to 0.

1063
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:14,210
Nevertheless, if you jump
into this rotating frame,

1064
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:17,700
all the spin states that
were static, for you

1065
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:19,890
they're rotating.

1066
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:23,350
And in fact, for you, they are
processing around the z-axis

1067
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:26,370
if you're in the rotating frame.

1068
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:29,180
Therefore, in the
rotating frame,

1069
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:33,360
you must have some Hamiltonian,
even though there's

1070
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,850
no Hamiltonian in
the static frame.

1071
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:40,960
Because in the rotating frame,
you feel things spinning.

1072
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,130
So in the rotating
frame, if there's

1073
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:47,120
a static spin along
the x direction,

1074
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:52,380
you now see it spinning around
the z-axis with frequency

1075
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:56,450
omega, in fact, going
the plus z direction.

1076
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:59,430
So in the rotating
frame you can ask,

1077
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:03,310
what is the new Hamiltonian
in the rotating frame?

1078
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,450
I mean, the rotating
frame, the Hamiltonian

1079
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:18,070
should be such that it rotates
the spins with angular velocity

1080
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:20,650
omega around the z-axis.

1081
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:25,470
You may recall that this is
done by all the unitary operator

1082
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:33,040
E to the minus i omega
t Sz hat over h-bar.

1083
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:38,740
This is the operator
that rotates, spins,

1084
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:42,460
with omega t around
the z direction, which

1085
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:46,150
is precisely what you want
this Hamiltonian to do.

1086
01:19:46,150 --> 01:19:52,490
So the Hamiltonian must
be e to the minus i ht.

1087
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:57,920
So this rotating Hamiltonian
must be omega Sz hat.

1088
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:03,360
So the Hamiltonian
in the new frame

1089
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:07,470
is that because that Hamiltonian
produces the rotation of states

1090
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:11,270
that you see because your
friend that is not rotating

1091
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:13,710
is telling you that
no state is moving.

1092
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:15,430
H is 0.

1093
01:20:15,430 --> 01:20:17,610
So the intuition is
that you've passed

1094
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:19,620
from the original
[INAUDIBLE] to this one,

1095
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:22,440
and you have to add 6 this.

1096
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,240
But what we'll see
now is that you

1097
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,000
have to add the
little-- you have

1098
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,705
to do other things a little
if this is not equal to 0.

1099
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:37,360
Here is what we want to do.

1100
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:40,530
Now there's also a couple
of ways of doing this,

1101
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:44,090
but let me try a
little calculation

1102
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:46,710
to do this second part.

1103
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:52,150
So, we're going to take,
therefore, to have,

1104
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:57,040
for example of psi R a
rotating wave function

1105
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:01,760
that is going to be given
by a unitary operator

1106
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,640
times the physical wave
function you want to solve.

1107
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:09,340
This is what you
want, and this is

1108
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:14,220
what you hope has a
simpler dynamics, psi R.

1109
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:17,400
So, let's try to figure
out what is the Schrodinger

1110
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,770
equation for psi R if
you know the Schrodinger

1111
01:21:20,770 --> 01:21:22,430
equation for psi.

1112
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:30,600
So, I dt I h-bar dt
psi is equal to Hs psi,

1113
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:34,810
let's see what is the
Schrodinger equation satisfied

1114
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,220
by this one.

1115
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:47,590
So I h-bar dt of psi R
is I h-bar dt of U psi.

1116
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:50,450
So let's differentiate this.

1117
01:21:50,450 --> 01:21:56,860
This is I h-bar dt of U,
and I will have the psi.

1118
01:21:56,860 --> 01:22:02,480
But then I will put them a U
dagger, there and another U

1119
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:08,980
acting on psi so that
it gives me psi R.

1120
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:13,530
So the first derivative is
acting just on the U. I acted,

1121
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:18,560
and then I put U dagger U
and recreated the psi R.

1122
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:21,310
The other terms is
in which it acts

1123
01:22:21,310 --> 01:22:25,770
on psi, so I get plus I h-bar.

1124
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:28,520
The U goes away,
and now we get dt

1125
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:36,580
of psi, which is I h-bar
dt of psi is Hs I psi,

1126
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:38,060
so I must delete this.

1127
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:45,040
So the second term,
when I acted here,

1128
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,280
I act with the whole thing.

1129
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:50,070
I ddt, I h-bar ddt on psi.

1130
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:54,240
The U is out, and I put Hs psi.

1131
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:59,120
And here, I can, of
course, put a U dagger U

1132
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:04,590
and put back the psi R,
so I will do that as well.

1133
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:08,690
U dagger psi R.

1134
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:16,280
So actually you have now a
the Schrodinger equation which

1135
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:22,870
is of the form I
h-bar dt of psi R

1136
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:31,710
is equal to U Hs U
dagger plus I h-bar

1137
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:43,250
dt of U U dagger of
psi R. Now that's it.

1138
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:45,530
This is the new Hamiltonian.

1139
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:49,940
This is the rotating
Hamiltonian, essentially,

1140
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:53,770
that we're trying to figure out
that is going to be simpler,

1141
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:55,140
we hope.

1142
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:59,350
And there we go here.

1143
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:02,860
We have this similarity
transformation

1144
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:07,340
of the Hamiltonian and
we have this extra term.

1145
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:11,620
Now suppose the original
Hamiltonian had been 0.

1146
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:15,130
We want the new Hamiltonian,
given our argument,

1147
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:19,770
to be a this for the
rotating systems.

1148
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:26,440
So I will say that
this U is such

1149
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:34,170
that you get I h-bar dt U
U dagger being precisely

1150
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:37,780
omega Sz.

1151
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:48,235
And for that the U is nothing
else but e to the minus I omega

1152
01:24:48,235 --> 01:24:57,840
tSz over h-bar, which is in fact
that thing that we had there.

1153
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:01,536
So that's what U is.

1154
01:25:01,536 --> 01:25:09,030
And in that way, this whole
term becomes just omega Sz hat.

1155
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:13,670
So we're almost, in a
sense, done with this thing,

1156
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:18,850
because we have made
some good progress.

1157
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:22,320
Except that we still don't know
if everything has worked out

1158
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:23,660
or not.

1159
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:27,700
I'll continue here.

1160
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:33,460
And just one minute to
close up the discussion

1161
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:36,180
by saying what has happened.

1162
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:43,830
So, what has happened is that
we have found that there's

1163
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:57,870
a new Hamiltonian, HR equal U
Hs U plus I h-bar dtU U dagger.

1164
01:25:57,870 --> 01:26:03,870
And then U is given by e
to the minus I omega tSz

1165
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:07,190
hat over h-bar.

1166
01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:20,000
And psi-- as we
said, psi of t is

1167
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:30,440
equal to e to the I omega tSz
hat over h-bar psi R of t.

1168
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:37,880
So this came because we
said that psi R was going

1169
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:43,420
to be U psi, and therefore
I took U and the inverse

1170
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:44,230
and you get this.

1171
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:49,120
So look what the
problem has turned into.

1172
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:53,760
It has turned into
a problem for psi R

1173
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:59,000
with a Schrodinger equation
that has a Hamilton HR in which

1174
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,370
in this piece is very simple.

1175
01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:04,498
It's omega Sz hat.

1176
01:27:04,498 --> 01:27:08,800
And now the crucial
point is whether-- here I

1177
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:17,550
have U dagger-- whether this
thing is time independent.

1178
01:27:17,550 --> 01:27:20,160
And this should be
time independent

1179
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:23,810
if we got our physics right,
and that's exactly where we'll

1180
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:29,010
take on the next time, and
prove that it's time independent

1181
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:31,960
and then we can solve
the complete problem.

1182
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:36,680
All right, there will be
notes posted on this soon.

1183
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,830
Good luck finishing
your homework,

1184
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:42,400
and I think Monday is a holiday.

1185
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,230
Is that right?

1186
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:45,020
Well, no class Monday.

1187
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:47,270
We'll see you on Wednesday.
