8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,357
PROFESSOR: OK, so
let's get started.

9
00:00:27,357 --> 00:00:28,940
I just wanted to
make one announcement

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,340
before we start the lecture.

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,130
So Prof.

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,320
Zwiebach is a way again today,
which is why I'm lecturing.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,290
And his office hours he's
obviously not going to have,

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,350
but Prof.

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,030
Harrow has kindly agreed
to take them over.

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,235
So today I'll have office hours
four to five, and then Prof.

17
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:52,850
Harrow will have office
hours afterwards five to six.

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,960
So feel free to
come and talk to us.

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,410
So today we're going to
try and cover a few things.

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,770
So we're going to spend a
little bit of time talking about

21
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:10,760
eigenvalues and vectors,
which we've-- finishing this

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,230
discussion from last time.

23
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:19,110
Then we'll talk about inner
products and inner product

24
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,150
spaces.

25
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,360
And then we'll
talk about-- we'll

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:35,340
introduce Dirac's
notation, some of which

27
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,360
we've already been using.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,480
And then, depending
on time, we'll

29
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,795
also talk a little bit more
about linear operators.

30
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,200
OK?

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,470
So let's start with
where we were last time.

32
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,120
So we were talking about
T-invariant subspaces.

33
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:18,230
So we had U is a
T-invariant subspace

34
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,190
if the following is satisfied.

35
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:30,180
If T of U is equal to--
if this thing, which

36
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,860
is all vectors that are
generated by T from vectors

37
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,020
that live in U. So if
T is inside U itself.

38
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,139
OK?

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:59,170
And we can define this in
general for any U. However,

40
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,770
one class of these invariant
subspaces are very useful.

41
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,815
So if we take U to
be one dimensional.

42
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:27,770
OK/ and so that really means
that U I can write as some

43
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,000
whatever field I'm defining
my vector space over.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,180
Every element of this subspace
U is just some scalar multiple

45
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:41,890
of a single vector U. So this
is a one dimensional thing.

46
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:51,730
Now if we have a T-invariant
subspace of this one--

47
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,310
if this is going to be
a T-invariant objective,

48
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,716
then we get a very
simple equation

49
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:01,720
that you've seen before.

50
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,910
So we're taking all vectors
in U acting on them with T,

51
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,500
and if it stays
within U, then it

52
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,500
has to be able to be
written like this.

53
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,550
So we have some operator
acting on our vector space

54
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,000
producing something in
the same vector space,

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,310
just rescaling it.

56
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,520
OK?

57
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,670
For sum lambda, which
we haven't specified.

58
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,020
And you've seen
this equation before

59
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,860
in terms of matrices
and vectors, right?

60
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,920
This is an eigenvalue equation.

61
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:48,085
So these are eigenvalues
and these are eigenvectors.

62
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,060
But now they're just
an abstract version

63
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,300
of what you've discussed before.

64
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,420
And we'll come back
to this in a moment.

65
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,370
One thing that we just
defined at the end

66
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,470
is the spectrum of an operator.

67
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,482
The spectrum of T is
equal to all eigenvalues

68
00:05:18,482 --> 00:05:19,190
of that operator.

69
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,350
And so later on
these will become--

70
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,690
this object will
become important.

71
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,250
Let's just concentrate on this
and ask what does it mean.

72
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:54,722
So if we have lambda
being an eigenvalues,

73
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:55,680
what does that tell us?

74
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,160
What does this equation tell us?

75
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:07,250
Well, it tells us that
on U. So all I'm doing

76
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,050
is taking this term over to
the other side of the equation

77
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,370
and inserting the
identity operator I.

78
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,540
So this is in itself
an operator now, right?

79
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:40,650
And so this tells us also that
this operator, because it maps

80
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:46,170
something that's non-zero
to the null vector, this

81
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:55,810
is not injective, OK?

82
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:04,110
And you can even write the
null space of T-- of T minus I

83
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:14,600
lambda is equal to
all eigenvectors

84
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,400
with eigenvalue lambda.

85
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:22,710
OK?

86
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:28,440
So every eigenvector
with eigenvalue lambda,

87
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,250
T acting on it is just going
to give me lambda times

88
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,820
the eigenvector again,
and so this will vanish.

89
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,430
So for all eigenvectors
with that eigenvalue.

90
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:48,790
And we've previously seen that,
if something is not injective,

91
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:55,980
it's also not invertible, right?

92
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:13,125
So this lets us write
something quite nice down.

93
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,000
So there's a theorem.

94
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,050
Let me write it out.

95
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:27,160
So if we let T is in the space
of linear operators acting

96
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:33,309
on this vector
space v, and we have

97
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:41,409
a set of eigenvalues, lambda
1, lambda 2, lambda n,

98
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:54,970
distinct eigenvalues,
eigenvalues of T,

99
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:06,580
and the corresponding
eigenvectors, which

100
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:14,080
we will call U. OK, so the
sum set U1, U2, up to Un

101
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,600
with the correspondence
by their label.

102
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:30,740
So then we know that
this list is actually

103
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,770
a linearly independent set.

104
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,500
So we can prove this
one very quickly.

105
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,330
So let's do that.

106
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,660
So let's assume it's false.

107
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,300
So the proof is y contradiction,
so assume it's false.

108
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,130
And what does that mean?

109
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,900
Well, that means that there
is a non-trivial relation.

110
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:27,180
I could write down some relation
C1U1 plus C2U2 plus CkUk

111
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,162
equals 0 without
all the C's being 0.

112
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:33,620
And what we'll do
is we'll actually

113
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,920
say OK, let's do let--
so we'll let there

114
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:46,280
be a k, a value of k that's
less than or equal to n, such

115
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:53,630
that this holds for
Ci not equal to 0.

116
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,590
So we're postulating that
there is some linear dependence

117
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,856
on some of these things.

118
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:07,570
So what we can do is
then act on this vector

119
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:16,140
here with T minus lambda k times
the identity acting on this.

120
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,992
So this is C1U1 plus
dot dot dot plus CkUk.

121
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,030
OK?

122
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,050
And what do we get here?

123
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,700
So we're going to get, if
act on this piece of it,

124
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,660
this is an eigenvector,
so T acting on this one

125
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,080
would just give us
lambda 1, right?

126
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,860
And so we're going to get
products of lambda 1 minus

127
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,850
lambda k for this
piece, et cetera.

128
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:55,695
So this will give us C1 lambda
1 minus lambda k U1 plus dot dot

129
00:11:55,695 --> 00:12:05,310
dot up to the Ck minus
1 lambda k minus 1

130
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:10,500
minus lambda k Uk minus 1.

131
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,400
And then when we act
on this one here,

132
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,300
so this one has an eigenvalue--
the eigenvalue corresponding

133
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,690
to the eigenvector is lambda k,
so that last term gets killed.

134
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,355
So we get plus 0 lots of Uk.

135
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,120
And we know this is still 0.

136
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,950
And now we've
established, in fact,

137
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:40,030
these things here
are just numbers.

138
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,270
All of these things.

139
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,570
So we've actually
written down a relation

140
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:49,444
that involves less than k.

141
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:50,860
Actually, I should
have said this.

142
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,030
Let there be a least k
less than or equal to,

143
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,910
and such that we have
linear dependence.

144
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,640
But what we've just shown
is that, in fact, there's

145
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,240
a smaller space that's also
linear independent, right?

146
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:15,780
So we've contradicted what
we assumed to start with.

147
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,470
And you can just repeat
this procedure, OK?

148
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,765
And so this is a contradiction.

149
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:32,300
And so, in fact, there must
be no non-trivial relation

150
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,280
even for k equals n
between these vectors, OK?

151
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,960
Another brief
theorem that we won't

152
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:56,480
prove, although we'll sort of
see why it works in a moment,

153
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:08,120
is, again, for T in linear
operators on v with v

154
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:15,140
being a finite dimensional
complex vector space.

155
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,360
OK?

156
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,850
There is at least
one eigenvalue.

157
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:43,670
So I guess for this-- so T
has at least one eigenvalue.

158
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,600
Now remember, in
the last lecture,

159
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,390
we looked at a matrix,
two by two matrix, that

160
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,780
was rotations in the
xy-plane and found

161
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,910
there were, in fact,
no eigenvalues.

162
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,780
But that's because we were
looking at a real vector space.

163
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:11,570
So we were looking at
rotations of the real plane.

164
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,650
So this is something
that you can prove.

165
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,560
We will see why it's true,
but we won't prove it.

166
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,580
And so one way of saying
this is to go to a basis.

167
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,235
And so everything we've said
so far about eigenvalues

168
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:30,590
and eigenvectors has
not been referring

169
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,720
to any particular basis.

170
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,495
And in fact, eigenvalues
are basis independent.

171
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,660
But we can use a basis.

172
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,220
And then we have matrix
representations of operators

173
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,030
that we've talked about.

174
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,900
And sort of this
operator equation,

175
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:56,250
or the operator statement
that T minus lambda

176
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:10,030
I-- so as operator statement
T minus lambda I U equals 0

177
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:17,757
is equivalent to saying that--
well, we've said it here.

178
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:19,340
We said that it's
equivalent to saying

179
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,740
that it's not invertible.

180
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,110
This operator is not invertible.

181
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,330
But that's also
equivalent to saying

182
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,285
that the matrix representation
of it in any basis

183
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,035
is not invertible.

184
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,170
And by here we just mean
inverses as in the inverses

185
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,380
that you've taken the many
matrices in your lives.

186
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:15,550
And so what that means then,
if-- I'm sure you remember.

187
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,329
If a matrix is not
invertible, that

188
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,619
means it has a
vanishing determinant.

189
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:24,069
So it has debt of this.

190
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:26,849
Now you can think
of this as a matrix.

191
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:30,460
This determinant has to be 0.

192
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,120
And remembering we can
write this thing out.

193
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,250
And so it has lambdas
on the diagonal,

194
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,510
and then whatever entries
T has wherever it wants.

195
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,150
This just gives us a
polynomial in lambda, right?

196
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:48,090
So this gives us some f of
lambda, which is a polynomial.

197
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,800
And if you remember,
this is called

198
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,370
the characteristic polynomial.

199
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:52,995
Characteristic.

200
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,350
Right?

201
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:11,410
And so we can write it, if we
want, as just some f of lambda

202
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,050
is equal to just,
in this case, it's

203
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,565
going to be just lambda
minus some lambda 1.

204
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,030
I have to be able to
write it like this.

205
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:33,650
I can just break it
up into these terms

206
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:40,830
here, where the lambda I's,
the 0's of this polynomial

207
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,115
are, in general, complex
and can be repeated.

208
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,362
Now what can happen is that
you have, in the worst case --

209
00:18:57,362 --> 00:18:59,570
I don't know if it's the
worst case, but in one case,

210
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,330
you could have all of
the singularities--

211
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,200
all of the the 0's
being at the same place.

212
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,230
And you could have a eigenvalue
that is in full degenerate

213
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,841
here.

214
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:13,340
Right?

215
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,780
So if we, say, have
lambda 1 occurring twice

216
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:21,690
in this sequence, then we set
out to a degenerate eigenvalue.

217
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,420
And in principle, you could
have just a single eigenvalue

218
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,170
that's in full degenerate.

219
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,040
But you can always write this.

220
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,040
There has to be one
lambda there at least,

221
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,820
one lambda I there at least.

222
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,220
And so you can see why
this is true, right?

223
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,395
Now if you're in a
real vector space,

224
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:47,230
you don't get to say that,
because this polynomial may

225
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,630
only have complex
roots, and they're not

226
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,440
part of the space
you're talking about.

227
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:53,940
OK?

228
00:19:57,232 --> 00:19:59,440
So it can be repeated, and
this is called degeneracy.

229
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,717
OK, so are there any questions?

230
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:10,800
AUDIENCE: Can you turn it?

231
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,871
It should be lambda
I minus T, just so

232
00:20:13,871 --> 00:20:15,650
that it matches the next line.

233
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,932
PROFESSOR: Thank you, OK.

234
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,870
Thank you.

235
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:29,762
I could have flipped the sign
on the next line as well.

236
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:30,720
So any other questions?

237
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:34,940
No?

238
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:40,710
OK, so let's move on and we
can talk about inner products.

239
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,750
And so first, what
is an inner product?

240
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:57,170
So an inner product is a map,
but it's a very specific map.

241
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:16,210
So an inner product
on a vector space V

242
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:33,110
is a map from V cross
V to the field, F.

243
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,590
And that's really
what it's going to be.

244
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,740
Now who has seen an
inner product somewhere?

245
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,647
OK, what do we call it?

246
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:44,701
AUDIENCE: Dot product.

247
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:45,950
PROFESSOR: Dot product, right.

248
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,110
So we can learn a
lot from thinking

249
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:53,820
about this simple case, so
the motivation for thinking

250
00:21:53,820 --> 00:22:00,170
about this is really
the dot product.

251
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:05,880
So we have a vector space Rn.

252
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,510
OK?

253
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:15,050
And on that vector space, we
might have two vectors, a,

254
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,260
which I'm going to write as a1.

255
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,010
a2 dot dot dot.

256
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,900
a2 dot dot dot. an, and b.

257
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,990
So we have two vectors, and
these are in vector space V.

258
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:36,999
Then we can define
the dot product, which

259
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:38,790
is an example of one
of these in a product.

260
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:45,200
So a dot b.

261
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,120
We can even put little
vectors over these.

262
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,030
And so our definitions that
we've used for many years

263
00:22:53,030 --> 00:23:04,020
is that this is a1 b1 plus
a2 b2 plus dot dot dot an bn.

264
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,230
And you see that this
does what we want it.

265
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,560
So it takes two vectors which
live in our vector space.

266
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,650
And from that, you
get a number, right?

267
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:17,370
So this lives in R.

268
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,300
So this is a nice
example in a product.

269
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,700
And we can look at what
properties it gives us.

270
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,110
So what do we know
about this dot product?

271
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:45,890
Well, we know some properties
that it has is that a dot b.

272
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:52,800
So it doesn't care which order
you give the arguments in,

273
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,299
all right?

274
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,350
Also, if I take
the same vector, I

275
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:07,650
know that this is got to be
greater than or equal to 0,

276
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,250
right?

277
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,560
Because this is going
to be our length.

278
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,910
And the only case where it's
0 is when the vector is 0.

279
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:38,910
Well we can write this.
a dotted in to, say,

280
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:45,440
b to 1 b1 plus b to 1 b2.

281
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,540
So this b2's are real numbers,
and these b's are vectors,

282
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,400
right?

283
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,370
So this thing we can just
write is equal to b to one

284
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:03,000
a dot b1 plus b to 2 a do b2.

285
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:09,220
And make them
vectors everywhere.

286
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,614
OK, so we've got
three nice properties.

287
00:25:12,614 --> 00:25:14,280
And you can write
down more if you want,

288
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,817
but this will be enough for us.

289
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,900
And the other thing that
we can do with this is we

290
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,300
can define the length
of a vector, right?

291
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:28,540
So we can say this is for
this defines a length.

292
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:45,370
And more generally, we only call
this the norm of the vector.

293
00:25:52,850 --> 00:26:00,520
And that, of course, you
know is that mod a squared is

294
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,710
just equal to a
dot a, all right?

295
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,475
So this is our
definition of the norm.

296
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:18,750
OK so this definition over
here is really by no means

297
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,330
unique in satisfying
these properties.

298
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:31,960
So if I wrote down something
where, instead of just say

299
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,600
a1 b1 plus a1 b2 et cetera, I
wrote down some positive number

300
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,620
times a1 b1 times some
other positive number a2 b2,

301
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,650
et cetera, that would also
satisfy all of these properties

302
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,774
up here.

303
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:48,565
So it's not unique.

304
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,280
And so you could
consider another

305
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:03,880
the dot product,
which we would write

306
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:17,420
as just c1 a1 b1 plus c2 a2
b2 plus some cn an bn, where

307
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:23,080
the c's are just
positive real numbers.

308
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,510
That would satisfy
all of the things

309
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,580
that we know about our
standard dot product.

310
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,870
But for obvious reasons,
we don't choose to do this,

311
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,540
because it's not a
very natural definition

312
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,050
to put these random
positive numbers along here.

313
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,460
But we could.

314
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,070
And I guess one
other thing that we

315
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:49,155
have is the Schwarz inequality.

316
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:03,700
And so this is the a dot b.

317
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:11,420
So the absolute value of
the dot product of a dot b

318
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:17,090
is less than or
equal to the product

319
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:21,150
of the norms of
the vectors, right?

320
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,540
And so one of the
problems in the piece

321
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,960
is to consider this in
the more abstract sense,

322
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,050
but this is very easy to
show for real vectors, right?

323
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,640
So this is all very nice.

324
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,560
So we've talked about Rn.

325
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,890
What we really are
going to worry about

326
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,460
is complex vector spaces.

327
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,290
And so there we have
a little problem.

328
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:53,580
And the problem
comes in defining

329
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,220
what we mean by a normal, right?

330
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:01,570
Because if I say now that this
vector has complex components

331
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,530
and write this
thing here, I'm not

332
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,710
guaranteed that this is
a real number, right?

333
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,250
And so I need to be
a little bit careful.

334
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:19,375
So let's just talk
about complex spaces.

335
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,360
And we really want to have a
useful definition of a length.

336
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:36,680
So let's let z be in this thing,
in interdimensional complex

337
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,180
space.

338
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:44,990
So really my z is equal
to z1 z2 zn, where

339
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:49,850
the zI line as
being in c, right?

340
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,905
So how can define a
link for this object?

341
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:57,015
Well, we have to do it
sort of in two steps.

342
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,080
So already know how
to define the length

343
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,450
for a complex number, right?

344
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,100
It's just the absolute
value, the distance

345
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,750
from the origin in
the complex plane.

346
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,690
But now we need to
do this in terms

347
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:15,670
of a more complicated
vector space.

348
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:19,720
And so we can really
think of this as

349
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:28,350
equal to the sum of the squares
of z1, of the absolute values

350
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,420
of these complex numbers.

351
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,170
OK?

352
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:47,195
Which if we write it out,
looks like z1 star z1 plus.

353
00:30:54,456 --> 00:30:55,430
OK?

354
00:30:55,430 --> 00:31:02,340
And so we should now, thinking
about the inner product,

355
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,130
we should be thinking
that the appearance

356
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:09,510
of complex conjugation is
not entirely unnatural.

357
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:13,370
So if we ask about the
length of a vector here,

358
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,900
then that's going to arise
from an inner product.

359
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,510
OK?

360
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:21,090
This object we want to arise
from our inner product.

361
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:29,561
So we can now define our general
in a product with the following

362
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:30,060
axioms.

363
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,475
So firstly, we want to basically
maintain the properties

364
00:31:38,475 --> 00:31:40,600
that we've written down
here, because we don't want

365
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,831
to make our dot product not
being in an inner product

366
00:31:43,831 --> 00:31:44,330
anymore.

367
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,880
That'd be kind of silly.

368
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,640
So let's define our inner
product in the following way.

369
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,750
I'm going to write it
in a particular way.

370
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:03,060
So the inner product is
going to be, again, a map.

371
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,290
And it's going to take our
vector space, two elements

372
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:11,520
of the vector
space to the field.

373
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,200
And I'm in a complex
vector space.

374
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,030
So it's a map that I'm
going to right like

375
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:29,835
this that takes v cross v to c.

376
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,730
OK?

377
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:39,300
And what I mean here is you put
the two elements of your vector

378
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,680
space in these positions
in this thing, OK?

379
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:49,530
And so really a b is
what I mean by this.

380
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:54,940
Where a and b-- so let
me write it this way.

381
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:03,800
So this thing is in c for a
and b are in the v, right?

382
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,420
So these things
dots are where I'm

383
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,720
going to plug-in my vectors.

384
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,005
And so this inner product
should satisfy some axioms.

385
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,040
And they look very much like
what we've written here.

386
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,060
So the first one is a
slight modification.

387
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:31,600
We want that a b is
equal not to b a,

388
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,690
but to its complex
conjugate, OK?

389
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,245
And this is related to
what I was discussing here.

390
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:48,510
But from this, we can see that
the product of a with itself

391
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:52,440
is always real, because it
and its complex conjugate

392
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,350
are the same.

393
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,450
So we know that a a is real.

394
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,180
And we're also going
to demand a definition

395
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,920
of this inner a
product that this

396
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,980
is greater than or equal to 0.

397
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:13,170
And it's only 0 if a equals 0.

398
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,820
Right?

399
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,230
So that's pretty much unchanged.

400
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:22,060
And then we want the same
sort of distributivity.

401
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:34,260
We do want to have that a
inner producted with B to 1 b

402
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:49,082
plus B to 2 b2 should be equal
to B to 1 a b1 plus B to 2

403
00:34:49,082 --> 00:34:58,213
a b2 where the [INAUDIBLE] are
just complex numbers, right?

404
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,270
And that's what we
need to ask of this.

405
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:12,270
And then we can make a
sensible definitions of it

406
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:18,360
that will give us a
useful norm as well.

407
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,900
Now I'll just make one remark.

408
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:26,410
This notation here,
this is due to Dirac.

409
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:35,210
And so it's very
prevalent in physics.

410
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:40,480
You will see in most purely
mathematical literature

411
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:48,210
you will see this
written just like this.

412
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:52,210
So let me write it as a b and
put these things in explicitly.

413
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:04,710
And sometimes you'll even see
a combination of these written

414
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:09,520
like this, OK/ But they
all mean the same thing.

415
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,730
Compared to what
we've written up here,

416
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,610
this seems a little asymmetric
between the two items, right?

417
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,510
Well firstly, these
are isometric.

418
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,660
And then down here
we've shown something

419
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,840
about that we demand something
about the second argument,

420
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,090
but we don't demand the same
thing about the first argument.

421
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,260
So why not?

422
00:36:44,062 --> 00:36:47,570
Can anyone see?

423
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:52,561
I guess what we would demand
is exactly the same thing

424
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:53,436
the other way around.

425
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:06,520
So we would demand
another thing that

426
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:18,140
would be sort of alpha
1 a plus alpha 2 a2 b

427
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,340
is equal to-- well,
something like this.

428
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,595
Well, we would
actually demand this.

429
00:37:30,595 --> 00:37:32,675
a1 b.

430
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,120
But I don't actually
need to demand that,

431
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,020
because that follows
from number one, right?

432
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,720
I take axiom one,
apply it to this,

433
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,262
and I automatically
get this thing here.

434
00:37:55,262 --> 00:37:56,610
OK?

435
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:02,350
And notice what's
arisen is-- actually

436
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,540
let's just go through
that, because you really

437
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:08,286
do want to see these complex
conjugates appearing here,

438
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,515
because they are important.

439
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,160
So this follows.

440
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,630
So 1 plus 3, imply this.

441
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,770
Let's just do this.

442
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:25,570
So let's start with
this expression

443
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,050
and start with this piece.

444
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,940
And we know that
this will then be

445
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:40,310
given by axiom one by b alpha
1 a 1 plus alpha 2 a2 complex

446
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:44,570
conjugate, all right?

447
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:48,200
And then by this linearity
of the second argument

448
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,640
we can now distribute
this piece, right?

449
00:38:51,640 --> 00:39:06,260
We can write this is alpha
1 b a1 plus alpha 2 b a2,

450
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,350
all complex conjugated.

451
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:13,080
Which let's put
all the steps in.

452
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,190
Is alpha 1 star
and this one star.

453
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,640
And then, again, by the first
argument, by the first axiom,

454
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,810
we can flip these and get rid
of the complex conjugation.

455
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:39,330
And that gives us this
one up here, right?

456
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:42,370
So we only need to define
this linearity, distributive

457
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,130
property on one
side of this thing.

458
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,463
We could have chosen to define
it here and wouldn't have

459
00:39:46,463 --> 00:39:49,200
needed that one, but we didn't.

460
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,685
OK, so let's look at
a couple of examples.

461
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,520
And the first one is a
finite dimensional example.

462
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,660
And we're going to
take v is equal to cn.

463
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,440
And our definition
is going to be

464
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,960
a pretty natural
generalization of what

465
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,335
we've written down before.

466
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,980
So a and b are elements of cn.

467
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:25,200
And this is just
going to be a1 star

468
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:34,975
b1 plus a2 star b2
plus an star bn.

469
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,590
Another piece of chalk.

470
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:46,650
So the only difference from dot
product in real vector space

471
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,540
is that we've put this
complex conjugates here.

472
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,785
And that you can check
satisfies all of these axioms.

473
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,590
Another example is
actually an example

474
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:02,890
of an infinite
dimensional vector space.

475
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:15,960
Let's take v is the set
of all complex functions,

476
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:27,180
all f of x that are in c with x
living in some finite interval.

477
00:41:30,275 --> 00:41:30,775
OK?

478
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:39,760
And so a natural norm to
define on this space-- and this

479
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,260
is something that we
can certainly talk about

480
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:49,260
in recitations-- is that if
I have f and g in this vector

481
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:56,990
space v, then f g
I'm going to define--

482
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:00,126
this is my definition of
what the dot product is--

483
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:06,961
is the integral from 0 to
l f star of x g of x dx.

484
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:10,416
OK?

485
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,100
If you think of this as
arising from evaluating

486
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,330
f at a set of discrete
points where you've

487
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,210
got a finite dimensional
vector space,

488
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:26,390
and then letting the space
between those points go to 0,

489
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:30,090
this is kind of the
natural thing to arise.

490
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,730
It's really an integral
as a limit of a sum.

491
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,610
And over here, of course,
I could write this one

492
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:40,850
as just the sum over
i of ai star bi.

493
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:44,500
i equals 1 to n.

494
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,560
And so this is the integral
is infinite dimensional

495
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,320
generalization of the
sum, and so we have this.

496
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,720
And that might be something
to talk about in recitations.

497
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,220
OK?

498
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,370
So we've gone from
having just a vector

499
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:08,820
space to having a
vector space where we've

500
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:14,270
added this new operation on it,
this inner product operation.

501
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:18,770
And that lets us do things
that we couldn't do before.

502
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:29,825
So firstly, it lets us
talk about orthogonality.

503
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,720
Previously we couldn't
ask any question

504
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,967
about two objects
within our vector space.

505
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:45,925
This let's us ask a
question about two objects.

506
00:43:49,350 --> 00:44:07,240
So if we have the inner product
a b in some vector space V,

507
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:15,570
then if this is 0, we
say they're orthogonal.

508
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:21,690
We say that the vectors
a and b are orthogonal.

509
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,800
And I'm sure you know
what orthogonal means

510
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,340
in terms of Rn, but this
is just the statement

511
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:42,700
of what it means in a
abstract vector space.

512
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,413
This is the definition
of orthogonality.

513
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:56,170
So this is one thing if
we have a set of vectors.

514
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:16,950
e1 e2 en, such that ei ej is
equal to delta ij, chronic

515
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:21,280
to delta ij, this
set is orthonormal.

516
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,810
Again, a word you've
seen many times.

517
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:55,940
OK, so we can also define
the components of vectors

518
00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:00,195
now in basis dependent way.

519
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:15,450
We're going to choose ei to be
a set of vectors in our vector

520
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:24,030
space V. We previously
had things that

521
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:35,460
form a basis, a basis
of V. And if we also

522
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:49,670
demand that they're
orthonormal, then we can-- well,

523
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:51,670
we can always decompose
any vector in V

524
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,530
in terms of its basis, right?

525
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,770
But if it's also
orthonormal, then we

526
00:46:55,770 --> 00:47:01,970
can write a, which is
a is some vector in V.

527
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:12,460
a is equal to the sum over i
equals 1 to n of some ai ei.

528
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,740
So we can do that for any basis.

529
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:20,940
But then we can take this vector
and form its inner product

530
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,090
with the basis vectors.

531
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:31,350
So we can look at
what ek a is, right?

532
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:34,880
So we have our basis vectors
ek, and we take one of them

533
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,470
and we dot product it
into this vector here.

534
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:39,700
And this is
straightforward to c.

535
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:44,160
This is going to be equal to
the sum over i equals 1 to n ai.

536
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,091
And then it's going to be the
inner product of ek with ei,

537
00:47:48,091 --> 00:47:48,590
right?

538
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:53,919
Because of this
distributive property here.

539
00:47:53,919 --> 00:47:56,190
OK?

540
00:47:56,190 --> 00:48:01,540
But we also know that, because
this is an orthonormal basis,

541
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:07,600
this thing here is a delta
function, delta ik, right?

542
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,540
And so I can, in fact,
do this sum, and I get

543
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:17,580
and this is equal to ak.

544
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,420
And so we've
defined what we mean

545
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:25,042
by a component of this
vector in this basis ei.

546
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:26,625
They're defined by
this inner product.

547
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:41,130
So we can also talk
about the norm, which

548
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:49,910
I think, unsurprisingly, we
are going to take the norm

549
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:53,160
to be, again, equal to
this, just as we did in Rn,

550
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:58,860
but now it's the more general
definition of my inner product

551
00:48:58,860 --> 00:48:59,950
that defines our norm.

552
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,330
And because of our
axiom-- so because

553
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:11,260
of number two in particular,
this is a sensible norm.

554
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,000
It's always going to be
greater than or equal to 0.

555
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:18,960
OK?

556
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:25,000
And conveniently we can also
change this Schwarz inequality.

557
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,550
So instead of the one
that's specific to Rn,

558
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:37,095
that becomes a b.

559
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:45,990
All right, so let's
cross that one out.

560
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:47,750
This is what it becomes.

561
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:50,020
And in the current
p set, you've got

562
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,130
to prove this is true, right?

563
00:49:54,130 --> 00:50:03,190
We can also write down
a triangle inequality,

564
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:07,810
which is really something
that norms should satisfy.

565
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:13,510
So the norm of a plus
b should be less than

566
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:18,060
or equal to the norm of
a plus the norm of b.

567
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:24,610
And the R3 version of
this is the longest side

568
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:27,830
of a triangle is shorter than
the two shorter sides, right?

569
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:32,800
So this is fine.

570
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:40,320
OK, so you might
ask why we're doing

571
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,900
all of this seemingly
abstract mathematics.

572
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,290
Well, so now we're in a
place where we can actually

573
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:54,120
talk about the space where
all of our quantum states

574
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,590
are going to live.

575
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,900
And so these inner
product space--

576
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:02,767
these vector spaces that
we've given an inner product.

577
00:51:02,767 --> 00:51:04,350
We can call them
inner product spaces.

578
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:22,590
So we have a vector space
with an inner product

579
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:27,065
is actually we call
a Hilbert space.

580
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:35,010
And so this needs
a little qualifier.

581
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,220
So if this is a finite
dimensional vector space,

582
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,100
then this is straight.

583
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,940
It is just a Hilbert space.

584
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,560
Let me write it here.

585
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:55,320
So let's write it as a
finite dimensional vector

586
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:59,660
space with an inner
product is a Hilbert space.

587
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,092
But if we have an infinite
dimensional vector space,

588
00:52:02,092 --> 00:52:03,550
we need to be a
little bit careful.

589
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:16,510
For an infinite
dimensional vector space,

590
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:17,945
we again need an inner product.

591
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:30,400
We need to make sure that
this space is complete.

592
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,510
OK?

593
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:34,560
And this is a kind
of technical point

594
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,680
that I don't want to
spend too much time on,

595
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,960
but if you think about-- well,
let me just write it down.

596
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,780
Vector space.

597
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,250
Let me write it here.

598
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,945
And I haven't defined what this
complete vector space means.

599
00:52:55,945 --> 00:52:57,820
But if we have an infinite
dimensional vector

600
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,420
space that is complete
or we make it complete,

601
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,670
then we have an inner product.

602
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:02,836
We also get a Hilbert space.

603
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,147
And all of quantum mechanical
states live in a Hilbert space.

604
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:12,063
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

605
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:22,700
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's true.

606
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,940
So how's that?

607
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:32,170
So we need to define what we
mean by complete though, right?

608
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:35,285
So I don't want to
spend much time on this.

609
00:53:35,285 --> 00:53:36,535
But we can just do an example.

610
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:54,350
If we take the space of-- let V
equal the space of polynomials

611
00:53:54,350 --> 00:54:01,270
on an interval 0 to L, say.

612
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:10,510
So this means I've got all pn's.

613
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:21,300
P0 plus p1x plus pn xn.

614
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:31,430
There are things that will
live in the completed vector

615
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:34,750
space that are not
of this form here.

616
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:38,822
So for example, if I
take n larger and larger,

617
00:54:38,822 --> 00:54:40,280
I could write down
this polynomial.

618
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:52,945
I could write pn of x is the sum
over i equals 1 up to n of i--

619
00:54:52,945 --> 00:54:58,470
x to the i over i
factorial, right?

620
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:03,860
And all of pn's live in
this space of polynomials.

621
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,350
But their limit,
as n becomes large,

622
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:12,210
there's a sequence of these
call it a cushy sequence

623
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:17,840
that, as n goes to infinity,
I generate something

624
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,790
that's actually
not a polynomial.

625
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:25,570
So I generate e
of x, which lives

626
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:31,490
in the completion of this,
but itself not a polynomial.

627
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:38,120
Don't worry about this
too much, but in order

628
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,570
to really define
a Hilbert space,

629
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,986
we have to be a
little bit careful

630
00:55:40,986 --> 00:55:42,445
for infinite dimensional cases.

631
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:53,580
OK, so a few more things
that we can do to talk about.

632
00:55:53,580 --> 00:56:02,300
Well how do we make
a orthonormal basis?

633
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:08,440
So I presume you've all
heard of Gram-Schmidt?

634
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,126
The Gram-Schmidt procedure?

635
00:56:10,126 --> 00:56:11,020
Yep.

636
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:16,340
OK, so that's how we
make a orthonormal basis.

637
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:20,130
And just the way
you do it in R3,

638
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,527
you do it the same way in
your arbitrary vector space.

639
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,110
So we have the
Gram-Schmidt procedure.

640
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:47,950
So you can define this-- so we
have a list v1, v2, vn are just

641
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:52,365
vectors in our vector space
that are linearly independent.

642
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:05,425
So we can construct
another list.

643
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,270
There's also orthonormal, so
it's a very useful thing for us

644
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:28,880
to have.

645
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,530
And so you could define
this recursively.

646
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:39,500
You can just write
that ej is equal to vj

647
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:47,360
minus the sum over
i less than j of ei.

648
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:07,250
So this thing divided
by its length.

649
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:14,750
And so by the sum,
you're orthogonalizing

650
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:17,410
ej versus all of the previous
ei's that you've already

651
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,550
defined.

652
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:22,650
And then you normalize it by
dividing by its length, right?

653
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:28,200
So that's something
that's very useful.

654
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,240
And the last thing I want to
say about these inner product

655
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:37,600
spaces is that we can use them--
these inner products at least,

656
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,910
is that we can use them to
find the orthogonal complement

657
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:45,390
of something, of
anything really.

658
00:58:50,490 --> 00:59:01,760
So let's let u-- so we
have a vector space V,

659
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,700
and I can just choose some
things in that and make a set.

660
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:16,358
So u is the set of
v that are in V.

661
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:18,030
So it doesn't need
to be a subspace.

662
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:18,900
It's just a set.

663
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:27,030
For example, if v
Rn, I could just

664
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:31,510
choose vectors pointing
along two directions,

665
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:32,760
and that would give me my set.

666
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:37,490
But that's not a subspace,
because it doesn't contain

667
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,490
some multiple of this
vector times some multiple

668
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:42,110
of this vector, which would
be pointing over here.

669
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:44,180
So this is just a set so far.

670
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:56,050
We can define u
perpendicular, which

671
00:59:56,050 --> 01:00:09,240
we'll call the orthogonal
complement of u.

672
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,310
And this is defined
as u perpendicular

673
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:20,200
is equal to the set
of v's in V such

674
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:34,270
that v u is equal to 0 for
all u in U. All of the things

675
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:37,690
that live in this space are
orthogonal to everything

676
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:40,560
that lives in U. OK

677
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:45,705
And in fact, this one is
a subspace automatically.

678
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:52,380
So it is a vector space.

679
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:59,440
So if I took my example of
choosing the x direction and y

680
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,910
direction for my set here,
then everything perpendicular

681
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,480
to the x direction
and y direction

682
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,100
is actually everything
perpendicular to the xy-plane,

683
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:14,190
and so that is actually
a subspace of R3.

684
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:23,070
And so there's a nice theorem
that you can think about,

685
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:26,630
but it's actually
kind of obvious.

686
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:35,050
So if u is a subspace,
then I can actually

687
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:39,360
write that V is equal
to the direct sum of U

688
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:43,766
plus its orthogonal
complement, OK?

689
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:52,940
So that one's kind of fairly
straightforward to prove,

690
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,810
but we won't do it now.

691
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:58,110
OK, so in the last
little bit, I want

692
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:04,354
to talk more about this
notation that I've introduced,

693
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:05,270
that Dirac introduced.

694
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:09,650
What can we say?

695
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:14,206
If I can find a
[INAUDIBLE] here.

696
01:02:14,206 --> 01:02:16,170
Are there any
questions about this?

697
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,505
Yep.

698
01:02:17,505 --> 01:02:22,024
AUDIENCE: So when we find space
and the idea of basis balance,

699
01:02:22,024 --> 01:02:24,730
why is that [INAUDIBLE]
decompose things

700
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:27,436
into plane waves when we're
not actually [INAUDIBLE]?

701
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:37,860
PROFESSOR: So it's because
it's-- basically it works.

702
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:39,980
Mathematically,
we're doing things

703
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,970
that are not quite legitimate.

704
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:54,360
And so we can generalize the
Hilbert space a little bit,

705
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,990
such that these non
normalizable things can

706
01:02:56,990 --> 01:03:00,060
live in this generalized space.

707
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:02,880
But really the answer
is that it works,

708
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,630
but no physical system is going
to correspond to something

709
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:06,190
like that.

710
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:07,890
So if I take plane
waves, that's not

711
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:11,980
a physically realizable thing.

712
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:14,440
It gives us an easy
way to, instead

713
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,580
of talking about
some wave packet

714
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:20,140
that some superposition
of plane waves,

715
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:22,250
we can talk about the
plane waves by themselves

716
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:24,715
and then form the wave packet
afterwards, for example.

717
01:03:29,165 --> 01:03:32,040
Does that answer the question
a little bit at least?

718
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,160
Yep.

719
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:41,489
AUDIENCE: If p could be written
as a sum of U [INAUDIBLE],

720
01:03:41,489 --> 01:03:45,430
why is U not [INAUDIBLE]?

721
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:47,480
PROFESSOR: Well, just
think about the case

722
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:48,615
that I was talking about.

723
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,720
So if we're looking
at R3 and we take

724
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:04,700
U to be the set the unit
vector in the x direction,

725
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,550
the unit vector in
the y direction,

726
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:08,210
that's not a
subspace, as I said,

727
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:10,964
because I can take the unit
vector in the x direction

728
01:04:10,964 --> 01:04:12,630
plus the unit vector
in the y direction.

729
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:15,520
It goes in the 45
degree direction.

730
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,620
And it's not in the things
I've written down originally.

731
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:22,780
So then if I talk
about the subspace,

732
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:30,200
the things spanned by x hat and
y hat, then I have a subspace.

733
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,580
It's the whole xy-plane.

734
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:38,050
And the things are
orthogonal to it

735
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:43,505
in R3 are just the things
proportion to z hat.

736
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:55,080
And so then I've got the
things in this x hat and y hat,

737
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,260
and the thing that's
in here is z hat.

738
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:03,730
And so that really is the basis
for my R3 that I started with.

739
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:07,060
That contains everything.

740
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:13,680
And more generally, the reason
I need to make this a subspace

741
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:23,200
is just because-- so I define
U by some set of vectors

742
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,260
that I'm putting into it.

743
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:27,020
The things that are
orthogonal to that

744
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:31,382
are automatically
already everything

745
01:05:31,382 --> 01:05:32,840
that's orthogonal
to it, so there's

746
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:36,720
no combination of the things
in the orthogonal complement

747
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,690
that's not already
in that complement.

748
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:44,480
Because I'm saying that
this is everything in V

749
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:50,610
that's orthogonal to these
things in this subspace.

750
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:53,720
So I could write down
some arbitrary vector v,

751
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:59,590
and I could aways write
it as a projection

752
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:01,590
onto things that live
in here and things

753
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:04,850
that don't live in
this one, right?

754
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:09,940
And what I'm doing by
defining this complement is

755
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:15,200
I'm getting rid of the bits
that are proportional to things

756
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:21,150
in this, OK?

757
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:22,219
All right any-- yep?

758
01:06:22,219 --> 01:06:23,760
AUDIENCE: So an
orthogonal complement

759
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,206
is automatically a subspace?

760
01:06:25,206 --> 01:06:25,830
PROFESSOR: Yes.

761
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:27,862
AUDIENCE: But that
doesn't necessarily

762
01:06:27,862 --> 01:06:32,437
mean that any random collection
of vectors is a subspace.

763
01:06:32,437 --> 01:06:33,020
PROFESSOR: No.

764
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,400
All right, so let's
move on and talk

765
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,600
about the Dirac's notation.

766
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,610
And let's do it here.

767
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:01,670
So three or four
lectures ago, we

768
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:05,310
started talking
about these objects,

769
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:09,210
and we were calling
them kets, right?

770
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:12,570
And they were things that
live in our vector space V.

771
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:17,000
So these are just a way of
writing down our vectors, OK?

772
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,640
So when I write down
the inner product,

773
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:29,210
which we have on the wall
above, one of the bits of it

774
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:31,810
looks lot like this.

775
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:40,450
So we can really think of
a b, the b being a ket.

776
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:42,600
We know that b is a
vector, and here we're

777
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,240
writing in a particular
way of writing things

778
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,670
in terms of a ket.

779
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:50,720
And what we can do
is actually think

780
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,810
about breaking this
object, this inner product

781
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:58,970
up into two pieces.

782
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:02,910
So remember the dot product is
taking two vectors, a and b.

783
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:06,240
One of them, we already have
written it like a vector,

784
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,500
because a ket is a vector.

785
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,450
What Dirac did in breaking
this up is he said,

786
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:19,330
OK, well this
thing is a bracket,

787
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:25,740
and so he's going to call this
one a ket, and this is a bra.

788
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:29,874
So this object
with something it.

789
01:08:29,874 --> 01:08:31,290
The things inside
these you should

790
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:33,960
think of as just
labeling these things.

791
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:34,760
OK?

792
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,700
Now we already know
this thing here.

793
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,859
So these kets are
things that live

794
01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:46,119
in-- I should say this
is direct notation.

795
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,450
OK, so we already
know these kets

796
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:56,819
are things that live
in the vector space.

797
01:08:56,819 --> 01:09:01,000
But what are the bras?

798
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:09,250
Well, they're not vectors
in V. So b is a vector,

799
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:10,779
so maybe I should've
called this one

800
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:13,050
b to be a little less confusing.

801
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:15,510
So b is a ket, and
this is something

802
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:19,170
that lives in our
vector space V.

803
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:23,950
This inner product we're writing
in terms of bra and a ket.

804
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:30,060
The bra, what does
it actually do?

805
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:35,200
So I'm going to use it to
make this inner product.

806
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:40,060
And so what it's doing
is it's taking a vector

807
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:42,454
and returning a complex number.

808
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:51,080
The inner product takes
v cross v goes to c.

809
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:56,000
But if I think of it as the
action of this bra on this ket,

810
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,740
then the action is that
this bra eats a vector

811
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:02,400
and spits back a
complex number, OK?

812
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,610
So a is actually a map.

813
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:14,010
OK?

814
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:17,950
So these bras live in
a very different place

815
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:20,898
than the kets do.

816
01:10:20,898 --> 01:10:23,740
Although they are going to
be very closely related.

817
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:30,980
So firstly, it's not in V. You
should be careful if you ever

818
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:32,790
say that, because
it's not right.

819
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:45,720
We actually say that it
belongs to a dual space, which

820
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:52,590
we label as V star, because it
is very dependent on V, right?

821
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:54,510
It's mapped from V to c.

822
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:00,110
And I shouldn't even say
this is a linear map.

823
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:13,410
Now what is V star?

824
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:16,230
Well, at the moment
it's just the space

825
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:19,040
of all linear maps from V to c.

826
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,630
Me But it itself
is a vector space.

827
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:31,405
So we can define
addition of these maps.

828
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:39,990
We can define addition on V star
and also a scalar modification

829
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:40,745
of these maps.

830
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:51,430
And so what that means is
that I can define some bra

831
01:11:51,430 --> 01:12:01,210
w That's equal to alpha lots
of another one plus B to b.

832
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:03,950
And all of these live
in this V star space.

833
01:12:09,064 --> 01:12:10,950
Let me write that explicitly.

834
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:22,120
So a b and w live in V star, OK?

835
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,950
And the way we define
this is actually

836
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:27,750
through the inner product.

837
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:48,850
We define it such
that-- so I take

838
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:53,270
all vectors v in the
vector space big V,

839
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:57,510
and the definition of
w is that this holds.

840
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:04,060
And then basically
from the properties

841
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:08,180
of the inner product, you
inherit the vector structure,

842
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:11,120
the vector space structure.

843
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,345
So this tells us V
star is a vector space.

844
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:32,290
Let's go over here.

845
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,030
And there's actually
a correspondence

846
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:42,000
between the objects in the
original vector space V

847
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,450
and those that live in V star.

848
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:54,070
So we can say for
any v in V, there's

849
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:57,740
a unique-- I should
write it like this.

850
01:13:57,740 --> 01:14:02,190
Any ket v in the
vector space, there

851
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:09,230
is a unique bra, which I'm
also going to label by v,

852
01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:11,265
and this lives in V star.

853
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:20,080
And so we can show uniqueness
by assuming it doesn't work.

854
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:37,870
So let's assume that
there exists a v and a v

855
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:57,050
prime in here such
that v-- so we'll

856
01:14:57,050 --> 01:15:01,200
assume that this
one is not unique,

857
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,250
but there are two
things, v and v prime.

858
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:10,200
And then we can
construct-- from this,

859
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,830
I can take this over
to this side here,

860
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:18,090
and I just get that
v w minus v prime w

861
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:30,260
is equal to 0, which I
can then use the skew

862
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,530
symmetry of these
objects to write

863
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:45,920
as w v minus w v prime star.

864
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,020
So I've just changed the
order of both of them.

865
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:53,590
And then I can use
the property of kets.

866
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:56,130
I can combine them linearly.

867
01:15:56,130 --> 01:16:06,700
So I know this is equal
to w v minus v prime star.

868
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:10,730
And essentially,
that's it, because I

869
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:15,280
know this has to be true for
every w in the vector space V.

870
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,800
So this thing is equal to 0.

871
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:25,510
And so the only thing that can
annihilate every other vector

872
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:29,290
is going to be 0 for
my definition, in fact,

873
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:31,950
of the inner product.

874
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:36,390
So this implies
that v minus v prime

875
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:42,980
equals 0, the null vector, which
implies that v equals v prime.

876
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:49,370
So our assumption was wrong,
and so this is unique.

877
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:52,080
OK, let's see.

878
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:58,540
And so we actually
have really a one

879
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:01,840
to one correspondence between
things in the vector space

880
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:07,440
and things in the
joule space, OK?

881
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:12,370
And so we can actually
label the bras

882
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:16,050
by the same thing that's
labeling the kets.

883
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:24,510
So I can really do what I've
done in the top line up there

884
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:27,040
and have something--
everything is labeled

885
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:31,540
by the same little v. Both
the thing in the big vector

886
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:33,510
space, big V, and
the thing in V star

887
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:36,750
are label by the same thing.

888
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:48,050
And more generally,
I could say that v--

889
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:52,480
so there's a correspondence
between this thing

890
01:17:52,480 --> 01:18:04,790
and this thing.

891
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:12,240
And notice the stars
appearing here.

892
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:16,680
They came out of how we
define the inner product.

893
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:27,410
OK, so really, in fact, any
linear map you write down,

894
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:33,100
any linear map like this
defines one of these bras,

895
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:35,040
because every linear
map that takes

896
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,860
to V to c lives in V star.

897
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:39,872
So there has to be an element
that corresponds to it.

898
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:45,960
And just if you want
to think about kind

899
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,930
of a concrete way of
talking about these,

900
01:18:48,930 --> 01:19:04,420
I can think of-- if I think
of this as a column vector,

901
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:10,411
v1 to vn, the way I should
think about the bras

902
01:19:10,411 --> 01:19:19,390
is that they are really what you
want to write as row vectors.

903
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:26,010
And they may have to have
the conjugates of the thing.

904
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:27,260
The components are conjugated.

905
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:37,030
OK, and now you can ask what
the dot product looks like.

906
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:48,370
Alpha v is then just this
matrix multiplication.

907
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:53,790
But it's matrix multiplication
of an n by 1 thing

908
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:54,910
by 1 by n thing.

909
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:14,130
Alpha 1 star alpha 2 star alpha
n star times this one here.

910
01:20:14,130 --> 01:20:18,384
So v1 vn.

911
01:20:18,384 --> 01:20:20,175
And this is now just
matrix multiplication.

912
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:34,915
I guess I can
write it like this.

913
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:48,980
So they're really,
really quite concrete.

914
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:51,710
They're as concrete
as the kets are.

915
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:54,370
So you can construct
them as vectors

916
01:20:54,370 --> 01:20:58,450
like strings of
numbers in this way.

917
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:01,602
So I guess we should finish.

918
01:21:01,602 --> 01:21:03,560
So I didn't get to talk
about linear operators,

919
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:06,070
but we will resume
there next week.

920
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:09,750
Are there any questions about
this last stuff or anything?

921
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:14,710
No?

922
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:15,210
OK.

923
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:17,380
So you next week, or see
you tomorrow, some of you.

924
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:17,880
Thanks.

925
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,230
[APPLAUSE]
