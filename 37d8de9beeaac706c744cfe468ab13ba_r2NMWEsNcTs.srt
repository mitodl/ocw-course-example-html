8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:27,970
PROFESSOR: Now, a theorem that
was quite powerful and applied

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:33,060
to complex vector
spaces for old V longing

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:40,560
to V complex vector space.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,340
This implied that the
operator was zero,

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:51,010
and it's not true for
real vector spaces.

13
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,620
And we gave a proof that
made it clear that indeed,

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,970
a proof wouldn't work
for a real vector space.

15
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,489
I will ask you in the homework
to do something that presumably

16
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,020
would be the first thing
you would do if you had

17
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,800
to try to understand why this
is true-- take two by two

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,420
matrices, and just see why
it has to be 0 in one case,

19
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,410
and it doesn't have to
be 0 in the other case.

20
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,140
And I think that will
give you a better

21
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,210
perspective on why this happens.

22
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,700
And then once you do
it for a two by two,

23
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,600
and you see how it works, you
can do it for n by n matrices,

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,250
and it will be clear as well.

25
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,220
So we'll use this theorem.

26
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,320
Our immediate application
of this theorem

27
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:50,150
was a well-known result
that we could prove now

28
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,680
rigorously-- that t is
equal to t dagger, which

29
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,200
is to say the operator
is equal to the adjoined.

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,740
And I think I will call
this-- and in the notes

31
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,570
you will see always the
adjoint, as opposed to Hermitian

32
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,780
congregate.

33
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,789
And I will say
whenever the operator

34
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:14,860
is equal to the adjoint,
that it is Hermitian.

35
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,150
So a Hermitian operator
is equivalent to saying

36
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:29,480
that v Tv is a real number
for all v. And we proved that.

37
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,450
In other words, physically,
Hermitian operators

38
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,320
have real expectation values.

39
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,420
This is an expectation value,
because-- as you remember

40
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,480
in the bracket
notation-- v Tv, you

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,230
can write it v T
v-- the same thing.

42
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,480
So it is an expectation value,
so it's an important thing,

43
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,890
because we usually deal
with Hermitian operators,

44
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,240
and we want expectation
values of Hermitian operators

45
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,770
to be real.

46
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,770
Now that we're talking
about Hermitian operators,

47
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:20,360
I delay a complete discussion
of diagonalization,

48
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,170
and diagonalization
of several operators

49
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,440
simultaneously, for
the next lecture.

50
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,600
Today, I want to move forward
a bit and do some other things.

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,310
And this way we spread out
a little more the math,

52
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,070
and we can begin to look
more at physical issues,

53
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,720
and how they apply here.

54
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,750
But at any rate, we're
just here already,

55
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,200
and we can prove two
basic things that

56
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,010
are the kinds of things
that an 805 student should

57
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,630
be able to prove at any time.

58
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,960
They're really very simple.

59
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:05,020
And it's a kind of proof that is
very short-- couple of lines--

60
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,760
something you should be able
to reproduce at any time.

61
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:16,070
So the first theorem
says the eigenvalues

62
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:22,600
of Hermitian operators-- H
is for Hermitian-- are real.

63
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:34,080
And I will do a little bit of
notation, in which I will start

64
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,030
with an expression, and
evaluate it sort of to the left

65
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,130
and to the right.

66
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,820
So when you have an
equation, you start here,

67
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,380
and you start evaluating there.

68
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:51,270
So I will start with
this-- consider v Tv.

69
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,040
And I will box it
as being the origin,

70
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,830
and I will start evaluating it.

71
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:12,230
Now if v is an eigenvector--
so let v be an eigenvector so

72
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:17,530
that Tv is equal to lambda v.

73
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,830
And now we say consider
that expression in the box.

74
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,590
And you try to evaluate it.

75
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,600
So one way to evaluate it--
I evaluate it to the left,

76
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,320
and then evaluate to the right.

77
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,830
Is the naive evaluation--
t on v is lambda v,

78
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,940
so substitute it there.

79
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,690
v, lambda v-- we know it.

80
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,740
And then by homogeneity,
this lambda goes out,

81
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:48,230
and therefore it's lambda v v.

82
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:55,730
On the other hand, we have
that we can go to the right.

83
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,970
And what is the way you move an
operator to the first position?

84
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,580
By putting a dagger.

85
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,480
That's a definition.

86
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,610
So this is by definition.

87
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,190
Now, we use that the
operator is Hermitian.

88
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:26,700
So this is equal to Tv v.
And this is by T Hermitian.

89
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,960
Then you can apply again the
equation of the eigenvalues,

90
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:39,220
so this is lambda v v. And
by conjugate homogeneity

91
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:46,760
of the first input,
this is lambda star v v.

92
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,550
So at the end of
the day, you have

93
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,300
something on the extreme
left, and something

94
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,405
on the extreme right.

95
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,230
v-- if there is
an eigenvector, v

96
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,810
can be assumed to be non-zero.

97
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,250
The way we are saying
things in a sense,

98
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,340
0-- we also think of
it as an eigenvector,

99
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,700
but it's a trivial one.

100
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,690
But the fact that
there's an eigenvalue

101
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,570
means there's a non-zero v
that solves this equation.

102
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,000
So we're using that non-zero
v. And therefore, this

103
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,670
is a number that is non-zero.

104
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,510
You bring one to the
other side, and you

105
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:35,640
have lambda minus lambda
star times v v equals 0.

106
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,490
This is different from 0.

107
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,480
This is different from 0.

108
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,340
And therefore, lambda
is equal to lambda star.

109
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:57,170
So it's a classic proof--
relatively straightforward.

110
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:02,190
The second theorem is
as simple to prove.

111
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,300
And it's already interesting.

112
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,660
And it states that different
eigenvectors of a Hermitian

113
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,490
operator-- well,
different eigenvalues

114
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,380
of Hermitian
operators correspond

115
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,630
to orthogonal eigenfunctions,
or eigenvectors.

116
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:35,140
So different eigenvalues
of Hermitian ops correspond

117
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:43,080
to orthogonal eigenfunctions--
eigenvectors, I'm sorry.

118
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,080
So what are we saying here?

119
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,340
We're saying that
suppose you have a v1

120
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,480
that [INAUDIBLE] T
gives you a lambda1 v1.

121
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,160
That's one eigenvalue.

122
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,110
You have another one-- v2
is equal to lambda 2 v2,

123
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,430
and lambda 1 is
different from lambda 2.

124
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,990
Now, just focusing on a fact
that is going to show up later,

125
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,630
is going to make
life interesting,

126
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,460
is that some
eigenvalues may have

127
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,180
a multiplicity of eigenvectors.

128
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:37,190
In other words, If a
vector v is an eigenvector,

129
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,530
minus v is an eigenvector,
square root of three v

130
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:45,240
is an eigenvector, but that's
a one-dimensional subspace.

131
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,180
But sometimes for
a given eigenvalue,

132
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,510
there may be a
higher dimensional

133
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,850
subspace of eigenvectors.

134
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,970
That's a problem of degeneracy,
and it's very interesting--

135
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,840
makes life really interesting
in quantum mechanics.

136
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,800
So if you have degeneracy,
and that set of eigenvectors

137
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,950
form a subspace, and
you can choose a basis,

138
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,850
and you could have
several vectors here.

139
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,630
Now what do you do in that case?

140
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,880
The theorem doesn't say much,
so it means choose any one.

141
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,790
If you had the bases
there, choose any one.

142
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,490
The fact remains that if these
two eigenvalues are different,

143
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,900
then you will be able to show
that the eigenvectors are

144
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,220
orthogonal.

145
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:39,530
So if you have some
space of eigenvectors--

146
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,320
a [INAUDIBLE] higher-dimensional
space of eigenvectors,

147
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,700
one eigenvalue, and another
space with another--

148
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,420
any vector here is orthogonal
to any vector there.

149
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,055
So how do you show this?

150
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,150
How do you show this property?

151
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:01,420
Well you have to
involve v1 and v2,

152
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,950
so you're never going to
be using the property that

153
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,950
gives Hermitian, unless
you have an inner product.

154
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,240
So if you don't have any
idea how to prove that,

155
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,810
you presumably at
some stage realize

156
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,720
that you probably have
to use an inner product.

157
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,760
And we should mix
the vectors, so maybe

158
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,100
a V2 inner product with this.

159
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,295
So we'll take a v2
inner product with T v1.

160
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,260
And this is interesting,
because we can use it,

161
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:44,960
that T v1 is lambda 1 v1 to
show that this is just lambda 1

162
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,495
v2 v1.

163
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,900
And that already brings
all kinds of good things.

164
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,110
You're interested in
this inner product.

165
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,420
You want to show it's
0, so it shows up.

166
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,640
So it's a good idea.

167
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,440
So we have evaluated
this, and now you

168
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,700
have to think of evaluating
it in a different way.

169
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,040
Again, the operator
is Hermitian,

170
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,120
so it's asking you to
move it to the other side

171
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,200
and exploit to that.

172
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,810
So we'll move it to the
other side a little quicker

173
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:15,430
this time.

174
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,720
It goes as T dagger, but
T dagger is equal to T,

175
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,380
because it's Hermitian.

176
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,230
So this is the center
of the equation.

177
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,140
We go one way.

178
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,880
We go the other
way-- this time down.

179
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:37,100
So we'll put T v2 v1, and
this is equal to lambda--

180
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:45,520
let me go a little slow
here-- lambda 2 v2 v1.

181
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,930
Your impulse should be it
goes out as lambda 2 star,

182
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,980
but the eigenvalues
are already real,

183
00:12:52,980 --> 00:13:05,210
so it goes out as
lambda 2 v2 v1,

184
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,640
because the operator
is Hermitian.

185
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,440
So at this moment, you
have these two equations.

186
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,800
You bring, say, this
to the right-hand side,

187
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:23,670
and you get lambda 1 minus
lambda 2 v1 v2 is equal to 0.

188
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,780
And since the eigenvalues
are supposed to be different,

189
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:33,810
you conclude that v1 inner
product with v2 is 0.

190
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,405
So that's the end of the proof.

191
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,160
And those are the
two properties that

192
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:56,660
are very quickly proven
with rather little effort.

193
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:02,240
So where do we go from now?

194
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,750
Well there's one more
class of operators

195
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,320
that are crucial in the physics.

196
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,280
They are perhaps as important
as the Hermitian operators,

197
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,070
if not more.

198
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:20,350
They are some operators that
are called unitary operators,

199
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,580
and the way I will
introduce them

200
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:35,130
is as follows-- so I will
say-- it's an economical way

201
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,523
to introduce them-- so we'll
talk about unitary operators.

202
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:54,210
If S is unitary,
and mathematicians

203
00:14:54,210 --> 00:15:07,180
call it anisometry-- if you find
that S acting on any vector--

204
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:12,940
if you take the norm,
it's equal to the norm

205
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,820
of the vector for all
u in the vector space.

206
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:32,600
So let's follow this, and
make a couple of comments.

207
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,740
An example-- a trivial
example-- this operator lambda

208
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,560
times the identity.

209
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,770
Lambda times the
identity acts on vectors.

210
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,810
What does it do,
lambda times identity?

211
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,040
The identity does
nothing on the vector,

212
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,800
and lambda stretches it.

213
00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:00,170
So lambda, in order not to
change the length of any vector

214
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,240
should be kind of 1.

215
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,100
Well, in fact, it
suffices-- it's unitary--

216
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,430
if the absolute value
of lambda is equal to 1.

217
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:19,400
Because then lambda is a phase,
and it just rotates the vector.

218
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,110
Or in other words, you
know that the norm of av

219
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,630
is equal to the absolute
value of a times

220
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,550
the norm of v, where
this is a number.

221
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,480
And remember these two
norms are different.

222
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,210
This is the norm of a vector.

223
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:44,210
This is the normal
of a complex number.

224
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:51,090
And therefore, if
you take lambda i u--

225
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:58,260
norm-- is lambda u is equal
absolute value of lambda u,

226
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,400
and absolute value of lambda
is equal to 1 is the answer.

227
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:09,599
So that's a simple unitary
operator, but an important one.

228
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:15,180
Another observation--
what are the vectors

229
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,670
annihilated by this operator u?

230
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,540
Zero-- it's the only vector,
because any other vector that's

231
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,570
nonzero has some length,
so it's not killed.

232
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,510
So it kills only zero.

233
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:42,790
So the null space of S
is equal to the 0 vector.

234
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:48,480
So this operator has no
kernel, nothing nontrivial

235
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,820
is put to zero.

236
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,740
It's an invertible operator.

237
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,870
So s is invertible.

238
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:05,680
So that's a few things
that you get very cheaply.

239
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,980
Now from this
equation, S u equals

240
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,270
u-- if you square
that equation, you

241
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:21,060
would have S u S
u is equal to u u.

242
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,700
Maybe I should
probably call it v.

243
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,890
I don't know why I called
it u, but let's stick to u.

244
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,980
Now, remember that
we can move operators

245
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,690
from one side to the other.

246
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,970
So I'll move this
one to that side.

247
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,580
If you move an S here,
you would put an S dagger.

248
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:46,290
But since the dagger
of an S dagger is S,

249
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:50,860
you can move also the S
to that side as S dagger.

250
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,920
So u S dagger, S
u-- you see that.

251
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,940
If you want to
move this one, you

252
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,130
can move it by putting another
dagger, and you get that one.

253
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,910
And this is u u,
and therefore you

254
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:16,810
get u S dagger, S minus
the identity acting on u

255
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:19,210
is equal to 0 for all u.

256
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,500
So for every vector, this is
true, because this is true.

257
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,200
We just squared it.

258
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,100
And now you have our
favorite theorem,

259
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,020
that says if this is true
in a complex vector space,

260
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,830
this is 0, and
therefore, you've shown

261
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,035
that S dagger S is equal to 1.

262
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,050
So that's another property
of unitary operators.

263
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,830
In fact that's the way
it's many times defined.

264
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,360
Unitary operators
sometimes are said

265
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,590
to be operators whose
inverse is S dagger.

266
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,710
I will not go into
the subtleties

267
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,270
of what steps in all
these things I'm saying

268
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:11,260
are true or not true
for infinite dimensional

269
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:15,340
operators-- infinite
dimensional vector spaces.

270
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,070
So I will assume, and it
will be true in our examples,

271
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,170
that if S dagger is an
inverse from the left,

272
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,880
it's also an inverse
from the right.

273
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:30,420
And perhaps everything is true
for infinite dimensional vector

274
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,240
spaces, but I'm
not 100% positive.

275
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:50,580
So S dagger is the
inverse of S. And that's

276
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,920
a pretty important thing.

277
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:04,160
So one last comment on unitary
operators has to do with basis.

278
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:13,980
So suppose you have an
orthonormal basis, e1 up to en.

279
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,015
Now you can define
another basis.

280
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,550
fi equal-- I'll
change to a letter

281
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:39,910
U-- U e i where U
is unitary, so it's

282
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:45,720
like the S. In fact,
most books in physics

283
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,450
call it U for unitary.

284
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,210
So maybe I should have changed
that letter in there, too,

285
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,340
as well.

286
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,190
So suppose you change basis.

287
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:02,580
You put-- oh, there
was something else

288
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,930
I wanted to say before.

289
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,170
Thanks to this
equation, consider now

290
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:14,830
the following thing-- S U Sv.

291
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:24,040
SUSv-- you can move
this S, for example,

292
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:30,370
to the other side--
S dagger S U v,

293
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:34,160
and S dagger S is equal
to 1, and it's Uv.

294
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,770
So this is a pretty
nice property.

295
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:41,030
We started from the
fact that it preserved

296
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:45,200
the norm of a single
vector, of all vectors,

297
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,670
and now you see that in fact,
it preserved the inner product.

298
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,160
So if you have two vectors, to
compare their inner product,

299
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,700
compute them after action with
U or before action with U,

300
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,620
and it doesn't
make a difference.

301
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,670
So suppose you define
a second basis here.

302
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,630
You have one orthonormal basis.

303
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,980
You define basis
vectors like this.

304
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:21,660
Then the claim is that the
f1 up to fn is orthonormal.

305
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,480
And for that you simply do
the following-- you just

306
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:36,840
check f i f j is
equal to U e i, U e j.

307
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,540
By this property, you can
delete both U's, rules,

308
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,550
and therefore this is e i, e j.

309
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,800
And that's delta i j.

310
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,920
So the new basis is orthonormal.

311
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,480
If you play with
these things, it's

312
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:06,460
easy to get some extra
curious fact here.

313
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:15,150
Let's think of the matrix
representation of the operator

314
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:24,310
U. Well, we know
how these things

315
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:28,770
are, and let's think of
this in the basis e basis.

316
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:37,480
So U k i is equal to ek U e i.

317
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:46,300
That's the definition
of U in the basis

318
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:58,160
e-- the matrix elements of
U. You can try to figure out

319
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,320
what is Uki in the f basis.

320
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,106
How does operator U
look in the f basis?

321
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,320
Well, let's just do
it without thinking.

322
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:18,720
So in the f basis,
I would put fk U fi.

323
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:30,750
Well, but fk is U ek,
so I'll put Uek Ufi.

324
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:44,000
Now we can delete both
U's, and it's ek fi.

325
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:53,930
And I can remember what
fi was, which is ek U ei.

326
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:57,700
And it's just the same
as the one we had there.

327
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,790
So the operator,
unitary operator,

328
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,456
looks the same in both bases.

329
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,690
That might seem strange or
a coincidence, but it's not.

330
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,200
So I leave it to
you to think about,

331
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,570
and visualize why
did that happen.

332
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,740
What's the reason?

333
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:30,000
So the bracket notation-- we've
been using it here and there--

334
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,650
and I will ask you to
please read the notes.

335
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,410
The notes will be
posted this afternoon,

336
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:41,180
and they will have-- not
maybe all we've done today,

337
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,360
but they will have some
of what we'll do today,

338
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,190
and all of what
we've been doing.

339
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,900
And the way it's
done-- it's first

340
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,800
done in this sort of
inner product language,

341
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,790
and then things are done
in the bracket language.

342
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,210
And it's a little
repetitious, and I'm

343
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,630
trying to take out some
things here and there,

344
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,250
so it's less repetitious.

345
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,260
But at this moment it's
probably worth reading it,

346
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,600
and reading it again.

347
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,748
Yes.

348
00:27:08,748 --> 00:27:13,230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] if you
have two orthonormal bases,

349
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:17,370
is the transformation between
them necessarily unitary?

350
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,597
PROFESSOR: Yes, yes.

351
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:23,850
All right.

352
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:28,590
So as I was saying we're going
to go into the Dirac notation

353
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,090
again.

354
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:33,160
And here's an example of a
place where everybody, I think,

355
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,940
tends to use Dirac notation.

356
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,060
And the reason is
a little curious,

357
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,553
and you will appreciate
it quite fast.

358
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,050
So this will be
the case of where

359
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:57,273
we return to x and p operators,
on a non-denumerable basis.

360
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,830
So we're going to
try to do x and p.

361
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,730
now this is the classic
of Dirac notation.

362
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,890
It's probably-- as
I said-- the place

363
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,370
where everybody likes
to use Dirac notation.

364
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:24,750
And the reason it's efficient
is because it prevents you

365
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,850
from confusing two things.

366
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,340
So I've written in
the notes, and we

367
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,150
have all these v's that
belong to the vector space.

368
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,580
And then we put
this, and we still

369
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,150
say it belongs to
the vector space.

370
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:46,310
And this is just a decoration
that doesn't do much.

371
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,050
And we can play with this.

372
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,660
Now, in the
non-denumerable basis,

373
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,490
the catch-- and the
possible confusion--

374
00:28:53,490 --> 00:29:02,030
is that the label is not quite
a vector in the vector space.

375
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:06,490
So that is the reason why
the notation is helpful,

376
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:11,300
because it helps you
distinguish two things that you

377
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,150
could confuse.

378
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,580
So here we go.

379
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:19,080
We're going to talk
about coordinate x,

380
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,260
and the x operator,
and the states.

381
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,500
Well, this is a state space.

382
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,360
So what kind of states
do we have here?

383
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,625
Well, we've talked
about wave functions,

384
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,250
and we could give
the value of the wave

385
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,430
function of different places.

386
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:40,560
We're going to go for a
more intrinsic definition.

387
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,525
We're going to try to
introduce position states.

388
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:56,060
And position states
will be called this-- x.

389
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:07,060
Now, what is the meaning
of this position state?

390
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:15,490
We should think of this
intuitively as a particle at x.

391
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,760
Now here's how you can
go wrong with this thing,

392
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,860
if you stop thinking
for a second.

393
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:37,330
What is, then, ax?

394
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:48,250
Is it ax, a being a number.

395
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,140
Is it the same thing?

396
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,630
No, not at all.

397
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:58,930
This is a particle
at the coordinate ax,

398
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:04,530
and this is a particle at x with
some different amplitude-- very

399
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,260
different.

400
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,500
So this is not true--
typical mistake.

401
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:14,770
This is not minus x.

402
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,450
That's totally different.

403
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,595
So there's no such
thing as this, either.

404
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,310
It doesn't mean anything.

405
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:34,990
And the reason is that these
things are not our vectors.

406
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:40,670
Our vector is this whole thing
that says a particle at x.

407
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:45,250
Maybe to make a
clearer impression,

408
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,310
imagine you're in
three dimensions,

409
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:50,210
and you have an x vector.

410
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:53,965
So then you have to ket this.

411
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:01,370
This is the ket particle at x.

412
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,930
x is now a vector.

413
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,320
It's a three-dimensional vector.

414
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,270
This is a vector,
but it's a vector

415
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:11,910
in an infinite
dimensional space,

416
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:15,480
because the particle
can be anywhere.

417
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,990
So this is a vector
in quantum mechanics.

418
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,090
This is a complex vector space.

419
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:25,880
This is a real vector space,
and it's the label here.

420
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:33,730
So again, minus x is
not minus x vector.

421
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,575
It's not the vector.

422
00:32:35,575 --> 00:32:41,060
The addition of the bra
has moved you from vectors

423
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,720
that you're familiar
with, to states

424
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,830
that are a little more abstract.

425
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:52,990
So the reason this notation is
quite good is because this is

426
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:56,490
the number, but this i---
or this is a coordinate,

427
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:00,090
and this is a vector already.

428
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,572
So these are going to
be our basis states,

429
00:33:02,572 --> 00:33:03,780
and they are non-denumerable.

430
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,260
And here you can
have that all x must

431
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,390
belong to the real numbers,
because we have particles

432
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:22,270
in a line, while this thing
can be changed by real numbers.

433
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,982
The states can be multiplied
by complex numbers,

434
00:33:24,982 --> 00:33:26,565
because we're doing
quantum mechanics.

435
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:33,260
So if you want to define
a vector space-- now,

436
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,990
this is all infinite dimension.

437
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,730
It's a little
worse in this sense

438
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,150
the basis is non-denumerable.

439
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:43,800
If I use this basis, I cannot
make a list of all the basis

440
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,540
vectors.

441
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,930
So for an inner product, we
will take the following--

442
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:58,220
we will take x with y to
be delta of x minus y.

443
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,090
That will be our inner product.

444
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:06,550
And it has all the properties
of the inner product

445
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,250
that we may want.

446
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:13,449
And what else?

447
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:18,370
Well at this moment,
we can try to-- this

448
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,800
is physically
sensible, let me say,

449
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,830
because if you have a
particle at one point

450
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,159
and a particle at another
point, the amplitude

451
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,440
that this particle at one point
is at this other point is 0.

452
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,710
And these states are
not normalizable.

453
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,880
They correspond to a
particle at the point,

454
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,710
so once you try to normalize
them, you get infinity,

455
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,000
and you can't do much.

456
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,179
But what you can do here is
state more of the properties,

457
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:46,860
and learn how to
manipulate this.

458
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:57,590
So remember we had one was
the sum of all e i e i.

459
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,890
The unit operator was that.

460
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:05,490
Well, let's try to
write a similar one.

461
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:09,505
The unit operator will
be the sum over all x's.

462
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,640
And you could say,
well, looks reasonable,

463
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,210
but maybe there's a 1/2
in here, or some factor.

464
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,260
Well, no factor is needed.

465
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:30,240
You can check that-- that you've
defined this thing properly.

466
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,650
So let me do it.

467
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:39,010
So act to on this
so-called resolution

468
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:48,060
of the identity with the vector
y, so 1 on y is equal to y.

469
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,777
And now let's add
on the right xxy.

470
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,670
This is delta of x minus y.

471
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,300
And then when you
integrate, you get y.

472
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,750
So we're fine.

473
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:13,120
So this looks a
little too abstract,

474
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,520
but it's not the abstract if you
now introduce wave functions.

475
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,830
So let's do wave functions.

476
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:26,930
So you have a particle, a
state of the particle psi.

477
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,790
Time would be random, so I will
put just this psi like that

478
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:34,690
without the bottom line.

479
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:37,350
And let's look at it.

480
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:39,343
Oh, I want to say
one more thing.

481
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:52,500
The x operator acts on
the x states to give x x.

482
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,400
So these are eigenstates
of the x operator.

483
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
We declare them
to be eigenstates

484
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,680
of the x operator
with eigenvalue x.

485
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,330
That's their physical
interpretation.

486
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:08,430
I probably should
have said before.

487
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:15,030
Now, if we have a psi as a
state or a vector, how do

488
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,530
we get the wave function?

489
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,860
Well, in this language
the wave function,

490
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:23,260
which we call psi
of x, is defined

491
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,365
to be the overlap of x with psi.

492
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:37,810
And that makes sense,
because this overlap

493
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:42,420
is a function of this label
here, where the particle is.

494
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,310
And therefore, the result
is a complex number

495
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,200
that is dependent on x.

496
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,590
So this belongs to
the complex numbers,

497
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:55,480
because inner products
can have complex numbers.

498
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,040
Now, I didn't put any
complex number here,

499
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,200
but when you form states,
you can superpose states

500
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,610
with complex numbers.

501
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:07,060
So this psi of x will
come out this way.

502
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:11,110
And now that you
are armed with that,

503
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:14,440
you can even think of
this in a nicer way.

504
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,290
The state psi is
equal to 1 times psi.

505
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,740
And then use the
rest of this formula,

506
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:30,940
so this is integral--
dx x x psi.

507
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,460
And again, the bracket
notation is quite nice,

508
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,360
because the bra
already meets the ket.

509
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:43,875
This is a number, and
this is dx x psi of x.

510
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,760
This equation has a
nice interpretation.

511
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,980
It says that the state is a
superposition of the basis

512
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:00,130
states, the position
states, and the component

513
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,690
of your original state
along the basis state

514
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:08,170
x is precisely the value
of the wave function at x.

515
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,270
So the wave function
at x is giving you

516
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:14,370
the weight of the state x
as it enters into the sum.

517
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:23,620
So one can compute more things.

518
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:27,750
You will get practice in
this type of computations.

519
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,730
There are just a limited type
of variations that you can do,

520
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:37,120
so it's not that complicated.

521
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,180
Basically, you can introduce
resolutions of the identity

522
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,710
wherever you need them.

523
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:47,050
And if you introduce too
many, you waste time,

524
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:51,220
but you typically get
the answer anyway.

525
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,970
So it's not too serious.

526
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,810
So suppose you
want to understand

527
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,213
what is the inner
product of two states.

528
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,000
Put the resolution of
the identity in between.

529
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:14,300
So put phi, and then put
the integral dx x x psi.

530
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:23,380
Well, the integral goes out,
and you get phi x x psi.

531
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:29,740
And remember, if
x psi is psi of x,

532
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:36,450
phi x is the complex conjugate,
so it's phi star of x.

533
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,240
And you knew that.

534
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,100
If you have two wave
functions, and you

535
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:45,700
want to compute the overlap, you
integrate the complex conjugate

536
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,700
of one against the other.

537
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,235
So this notation is doing
all what you want from this.

538
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,560
You want to compute a
matrix element of x.

539
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,920
Well, put another resolution
of the identity here.

540
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:19,740
So this would be integral
dx phi-- the x hat is here.

541
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,960
And then you put x x psi.

542
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,670
The x hat on x is x.

543
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,610
That's what this
operator does, so you

544
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:46,830
get integral dx of-- I'll
put x phi x x psi, which

545
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:50,160
is what you expect
it to be-- integral

546
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,260
of x phi star of x, psi of x.

547
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:06,930
Now we can do exactly the same
thing with momentum states.

548
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,790
So I don't want to
bore you, so I just

549
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:15,520
list the properties--
basis states are

550
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,830
momenta where the
momenta is real.

551
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:26,520
p prime p is equal delta
of p minus p prime.

552
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:33,900
One is the integral dp of p p.

553
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,725
And p hat p is equal to p p.

554
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:47,350
So these are the momentum bases.

555
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,530
They're exactly analogous.

556
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:53,600
So all what we've
done for x is true.

557
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,440
The completeness
and normalization

558
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,930
work well together,
like we checked there,

559
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:02,610
and everything is true.

560
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:07,830
The only thing that you need
to make this more interesting

561
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:12,860
is a relation between the
x basis and the p basis.

562
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,440
And that's where
physics comes in.

563
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,250
Anybody can define these two,
but then a physical assumption

564
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:27,560
as to what you really mean
by momentum is necessary.

565
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:31,070
And what we've said is
that the wave function

566
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:36,091
of a particle with
momentum p is e to the i

567
00:43:36,091 --> 00:43:42,370
px over h bar over
square root of 2 pi

568
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:49,280
h-- convenient normalization,
but that was it.

569
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,090
That was our physical
interpretation

570
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:55,010
of the wave function of a
particle with some momentum.

571
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:58,665
And therefore, if this is
a wave function, that's xp.

572
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:06,650
A state of momentum p
has this wave function.

573
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,400
So we write this.

574
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:21,130
OK, there are tricks you can
do, and please read the notes.

575
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:24,270
But let's do a
little computation.

576
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:29,930
Suppose you want to
compute what is p on psi.

577
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:32,350
You could say,
well, I don't know

578
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:34,770
why would I want to do
something with that?

579
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,370
Looks simple enough.

580
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:38,000
Well, it's simple
enough, but you

581
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,840
could say I want to see that
in terms of wave functions,

582
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,660
coordinate space wave functions.

583
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,530
Well, if you want to see them in
terms of coordinate space wave

584
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,330
functions, you have to introduce
a complete set of states.

585
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:58,430
So introduce p x x psi.

586
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,240
Then you have this
wave function,

587
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,380
and oh, this is sort
of known, because it's

588
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:10,566
the complex conjugate of
this, so it's integral dx

589
00:45:10,566 --> 00:45:19,300
px over h bar, square root
of 2 pi h bar times psi of x.

590
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,140
And this was the
Fourier transform--

591
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:26,260
what we call the Fourier
transform of the wave function.

592
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:33,840
So we can call it psi tilde
of p, just to distinguish it,

593
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,320
because we called
psi with x, psi of x.

594
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,190
So if I didn't put
a tilde, you might

595
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:41,450
think it's the same
functional form,

596
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:45,400
but it's the momentum
space wave function.

597
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:51,180
So here is the wave
function in the p basis.

598
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,690
It's the Fourier
transform of the wave

599
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:57,220
function in the x basis.

600
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:01,020
One last computation, and
then we change subjects again.

601
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:10,360
It's the classic
computation that you

602
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:15,530
have now a mixed situation,
in which you have the momentum

603
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:20,430
operator states and
the coordinate bra.

604
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:34,753
So what is the following
expression-- X p hat psi?

605
00:46:44,696 --> 00:46:45,195
OK.

606
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,750
What is your temptation?

607
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:57,170
Your temptation is to say,
look, this is like the momentum

608
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:02,490
operator acting on the wave
function in the x basis.

609
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:09,790
It can only be h bar
over i d dx of psi of x.

610
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:13,020
That's probably what it means.

611
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,730
But the notation
is clear enough,

612
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:19,120
so we can check if that
is exactly what it is.

613
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,360
We can manipulate
things already.

614
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,250
So let's do it.

615
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:28,900
So for that, I first have to
try to get rid of this operator.

616
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,840
Now the only way I know how
to get rid of this operator p

617
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,090
is because it has eigenstates.

618
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:40,890
So it suggests very strongly
that we should introduce

619
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,430
momentum states, complete them.

620
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:53,080
So I'll put v p x p hat p p psi.

621
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,770
And now I can
evaluate the little--

622
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:09,050
because p hat and p is little
p, or p without the hat.

623
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:17,570
So this is p xp p psi.

624
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:28,990
Now you can look
at that, and think

625
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,800
carefully what should you do.

626
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,250
And there's one
thing that you can

627
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:40,200
do is look at the
equation on top.

628
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,100
And this is a way to
avoid working very hard.

629
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:48,250
So look at the equation on
top-- x p is equal to that.

630
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:53,240
How do I get a p
to multiply this?

631
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,390
I can get a p to
multiply this xp

632
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:06,530
by doing h bar
over i d dx of x p.

633
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:17,790
Because if I see it there, I
see that differentiating by d dx

634
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:21,160
brings down an ip over h bar.

635
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,760
So if I multiply by h
bar over i, I get that.

636
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,055
So let's do this.

637
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:43,730
Now I claim we can
take the h over i d

638
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:47,690
dx out of this integral.

639
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:51,380
And the reason is that first,
it's not an x integral.

640
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:55,440
It's a p integral, and nothing
else except this factor

641
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,630
depends on x.

642
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:59,170
So I take it out and I
want to bring it back,

643
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,970
it will only act on
this, because this is not

644
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,920
x dependent.

645
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:10,930
So you should think of psi, psi
doesn't have an x dependence.

646
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:15,050
Psi is a state, and here is p--
doesn't have an x dependence?

647
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:18,280
You say no, it
does, it looks here.

648
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:22,060
No, but it doesn't have it,
because it's been integrated.

649
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,030
It really doesn't
have x dependence.

650
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:27,140
So we can take this out.

651
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:31,490
We'll have h over i d dx.

652
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:37,140
And now we have vp x p p psi.

653
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:44,850
And now by completeness,
this is just 1.

654
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:47,070
So this becomes x psi.

655
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:55,750
So h bar over i d dx of x psi,
which is what we claimed it

656
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:56,340
would be.

657
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:06,083
So this is rigorous--
a rigorous derivation.

658
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,260
There's no guessing.

659
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,670
We've introduced
complete states until you

660
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:17,490
can see how things act.

661
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:19,860
But the moral is here
that you shouldn't

662
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,730
have to go through this
more than once in your life,

663
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:23,750
or practice it.

664
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:27,270
But once you see something
like that, you think.

665
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:29,780
You're using x
representation, and you're

666
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,040
talking about the operator p.

667
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,140
It cannot be anything like that.

668
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:39,650
If you want to practice
something different,

669
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:49,860
show that the analogue p x
hat psi is equal i h bar d dp

670
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,920
of psi tilde.

671
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,670
So it's the opposite relation.

672
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,550
All right.

673
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,050
Questions?

674
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,212
Yes.

675
00:52:05,212 --> 00:52:09,256
AUDIENCE: So how's one supposed
to-- so what it appears

676
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:11,755
is happening is you're basically
taking some state like psi,

677
00:52:11,755 --> 00:52:15,486
and you're basically writing
in terms of some basis.

678
00:52:15,486 --> 00:52:18,430
And then you're basically using
the [INAUDIBLE] coordinates

679
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:19,470
of this thing.

680
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:23,780
But the question is, what does
this basis actually look like?

681
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,100
Like, what do these vectors--
because if you put them

682
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,400
in their own coordinates,
they're just infinite.

683
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,430
PROFESSOR: Yup.

684
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,290
AUDIENCE: They're not
even delta-- I mean--

685
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:33,790
PROFESSOR: They are
delta functions.

686
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:34,980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

687
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,980
PROFESSOR: These vectors
are delta functions

688
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:43,720
because if you have a state
that has this as the position

689
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,550
state of a particle,
you find the wave

690
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:47,580
function by doing x on it.

691
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,120
That's our definition
of a wave function.

692
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,670
And its infinite.

693
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:59,150
So there's is not too much
one can say about this.

694
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:02,830
If people want to work
more mathematically,

695
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:05,155
the more comfortable
way, what you do

696
00:53:05,155 --> 00:53:07,950
is, instead of taking
infinite things,

697
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:10,540
you put everything
on a big circle.

698
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:13,220
And then you have
a Fourier series

699
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:18,400
and they transform as sums,
and everything goes into sums.

700
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,210
But there's no real need.

701
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:22,510
These operations are safe.

702
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:27,920
And we managed to do them,
and we're OK with them.

703
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,150
Other questions?

704
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:31,334
Yes.

705
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:32,209
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

706
00:53:38,926 --> 00:53:39,925
PROFESSOR: Probably not.

707
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:45,000
You know, infinite
bases are delicate.

708
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,510
Hilbert spaces are infinite
dimensional vector spaces,

709
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:53,670
and they-- not every
infinite dimensional space

710
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,550
is a Hilbert space.

711
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:57,930
The most important
thing of a Hilbert space

712
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:00,840
is this norm, this
inner product.

713
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:05,980
But the other important thing
is some convergence facts

714
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:09,170
about sequences of
vectors that converge

715
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:11,220
to points that are on the space.

716
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,900
So it's delicate.

717
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,880
Infinite dimensional
spaces can be pretty bad.

718
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,550
A Banach space is
not a Hilbert space.

719
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:20,190
It's more com--

720
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

721
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,640
PROFESSOR: Only
for Hilbert spaces,

722
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:31,505
and basically, this problem
of a particle in a line,

723
00:54:31,505 --> 00:54:35,630
or a particle in three space
is sufficiently well known

724
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:40,410
that we're totally
comfortable with this somewhat

725
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,100
singular operation.

726
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:46,110
So the operator x
or the operator p

727
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:48,960
may not be what
mathematicians like them

728
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,950
to be-- bounded operators
in Hilbert spaces.

729
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:56,260
But we know how not to
make mistakes with them.

730
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:00,230
And if you have a very
subtle problem, one day

731
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,950
you probably have
to be more careful.

732
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:04,740
But for the problems we're
interested in now, we don't.

733
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:15,270
So our last topic today is
uncertainties and uncertainty

734
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,040
relations.

735
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,095
I probably won't get through all
of it, but we'll get started.

736
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,750
And so we'll have uncertainties.

737
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:43,850
And we will talk
about operators,

738
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:46,760
and Hermitian operators.

739
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,560
So here is the
question, basically--

740
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,550
if you have a state,
we know the result

741
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:57,380
of a measurement
of an observable

742
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:02,090
is the eigenvalue of
a Hermitian operator.

743
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:06,730
Now, if the state is an
eigenstate of the Hermitian

744
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,100
operator, you measure
the observable,

745
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:12,860
and out comes eigenvalue.

746
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:17,290
And there's no uncertainty
in the measured observable,

747
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:20,000
because the measured
observable is an eigenvalue

748
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,420
and its state is an eigenstate.

749
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:26,480
The problem arises when
the state that you're

750
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,600
trying to measure
this property is not

751
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,240
an eigenstate of the observable.

752
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,510
So you know that the
interpretation of quantum

753
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:40,040
mechanics is a
probabilistic distribution.

754
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,610
You sometimes get one thing,
sometimes get another thing,

755
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:46,280
depending on the
amplitudes of the states

756
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,500
to be in those
particular eigenstates.

757
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,450
But there's an uncertainty.

758
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,420
At this time, you
don't know what

759
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:57,690
the measured value will be.

760
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:01,620
So we'll define the uncertainty
associated to a Hermitian

761
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:05,855
operator, and we want to
define this uncertainty.

762
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:08,000
So A will be a
Hermitian operator.

763
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:20,400
And you were talking
about the uncertainty.

764
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,812
Now the uncertainty
of that operator--

765
00:57:22,812 --> 00:57:24,770
the first thing that you
should remember is you

766
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,870
can't talk about the
uncertainty of the operator

767
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:29,500
unless you give me a state.

768
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,370
So all the formulas we're going
to write for uncertainties

769
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:36,790
are uncertainties of
operators in some state.

770
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,635
So let's call the state psi.

771
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:50,510
And time will not be
relevant, so maybe I

772
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:56,890
should delete the-- well,
I'll leave that bar there,

773
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,470
just in case.

774
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:04,300
So we're going to try
to define uncertainty.

775
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:08,970
But before we do that,
let's try to define

776
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:11,350
another thing-- the
expectation value.

777
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:14,240
Well, the expectation
value-- you know it.

778
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,740
The expectation value of A,
and you could put a psi here

779
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:24,600
if you wish, to remind you that
it depends on the state-- is,

780
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:29,080
well, psi A psi.

781
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,520
That's what we call
expectation value.

782
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:36,710
In the inner product
notation would be psi A psi.

783
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:48,570
And one thing you know--
that this thing is real,

784
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:55,490
because the expectation values
of Hermitian operators is real.

785
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,280
That's something we reviewed
at the beginning of the lecture

786
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,080
today.

787
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:06,070
So now comes the
question, what can I

788
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:10,240
do to define an
uncertainty of an operator?

789
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:15,120
And an uncertainty-- now
we've said already something.

790
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:18,970
I wish to define an
uncertainty that is such

791
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:25,310
that the uncertainty is 0 if
the state is an eigenstate,

792
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,720
and the uncertainty
is different from 0

793
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,910
if it's not an eigenstate.

794
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:33,850
In fact, I wish that
the uncertainty is 0 if

795
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:38,130
and only if the state
is an eigenstate.

796
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:41,700
So actually, we
can achieve that.

797
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:50,140
And in some sense, I think,
the most intuitive definition

798
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:55,670
is the one that
I will show here.

799
00:59:55,670 --> 01:00:00,080
It's that we define the
uncertainty, delta A,

800
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,950
and I'll put the psi here.

801
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:10,060
So this is called
the uncertainty of A

802
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,285
in the state psi.

803
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:19,390
So we'll define it a simple way.

804
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:20,720
What else do we want?

805
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:25,010
We said this should
be 0 if and only

806
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:28,490
if the state is an eigenstate.

807
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:32,900
Second, I want this thing
to be a real number--

808
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,790
in fact, a positive number.

809
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:40,990
What function do we know
in quantum mechanics

810
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:43,000
that can do that magic?

811
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,940
Well, it's the norm.

812
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:48,610
The norm function is
always real and positive.

813
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:52,860
So this-- we'll try to
set it equal to a norm.

814
01:00:52,860 --> 01:01:00,870
So it's the norm of the
state A minus the expectation

815
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:08,240
value of A times
1 acting on psi.

816
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,170
This will be our definition
of the uncertainty.

817
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:18,233
So it's the norm of this vector.

818
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,700
Now let's look at this.

819
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:32,730
Suppose the norm
uncertainty is 0.

820
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:40,180
And if the uncertainty is
0, this vector must be 0.

821
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:49,960
So A minus expectation
value of A on psi is 0.

822
01:01:49,960 --> 01:02:00,330
Or A psi is equal to
expectation value of A on psi.

823
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:02,090
The 1 doesn't do much.

824
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:04,460
Many people don't write the 1.

825
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:08,030
I could get tired
and stop writing it.

826
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:13,630
You should-- probably it's
good manners to write the i,

827
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:16,910
but it's not all that necessary.

828
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:18,500
You don't get that confused.

829
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,970
If there's an operator
and a number here,

830
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:24,310
it must be an identity matrix.

831
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:28,880
So the uncertainty is 0, the
vector is 0, then this is true.

832
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,200
Now, you say, well, this
equation looks kind of funny,

833
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:37,270
but it says that psi
is an eigenstate of A,

834
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:40,230
because this is a number.

835
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:42,300
It looks a little
funny, because we're

836
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:46,580
accustomed to A psi lambda
psi, but this is a number.

837
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:49,410
And in fact, let me
show you one thing.

838
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:57,320
If you have A psi equal
lambda psi-- oh, I

839
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,426
should say here that
psi is normalized.

840
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:08,010
If psi would not be normalized,
you change the normalization.

841
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:10,765
You change the uncertainty.

842
01:03:10,765 --> 01:03:11,890
So it should be normalized.

843
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:19,980
And look at this-- if you
have a psi equal lambda psi,

844
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:27,130
do the inner product with psi.

845
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:33,510
Psi comma A psi would
be equal to lambda,

846
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,810
because psi inner
product with psi is 1.

847
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:38,310
But what is this?

848
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:41,730
This is the
expectation value of A.

849
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:46,010
So actually, given
our definition,

850
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:50,750
the eigenvalue of some
operator on this state

851
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:53,720
is the expectation value of
the operator in the state.

852
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:58,910
So back to the argument--
if the uncertainty is 0,

853
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:01,000
the state is an eigenstate.

854
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,130
And the eigenvalue happens to
be the expectation value-- that

855
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:07,480
is, if the uncertainty is 0.

856
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:12,220
On the other hand, if you are
in an eigenstate, you're here.

857
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:15,180
Then lambda is A,
and this equation

858
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,470
shows that this vector is
0, and therefore you get 0.

859
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:25,860
So you've shown that this norm
or this uncertainty is 0, if

860
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:29,820
and only if the state
is an eigenstate.

861
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:32,550
And that's a very
powerful statement.

862
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:36,130
The statement that's
always known by everybody

863
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:40,480
is that if you have
an eigenstate-- yes--

864
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,450
no uncertainty.

865
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:45,700
But if there's no uncertainty,
you must have an eigenstate.

866
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:48,360
That's the second
part, and uses the fact

867
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:53,420
that the only vector with 0 norm
is the zero vector-- a thing

868
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:56,490
that we use over and over again.

869
01:04:56,490 --> 01:05:00,930
So let me make a
couple more comments

870
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:02,430
on how you compute this.

871
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:09,525
So that's the
uncertainty so far.

872
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,970
So the uncertainty
vanishes in that case.

873
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:24,420
Now, we can square this
equation to find a formula that

874
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:30,130
is perhaps more familiar--
not necessarily more useful,

875
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:31,440
but also good.

876
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,500
For computations, it's
pretty good-- delta A

877
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,180
of psi, which is
real-- we square it.

878
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:42,100
Well, the norm square
is the inner product

879
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:58,560
of this A minus A
psi A minus A psi.

880
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,090
Norm squared is the inner
product of these two vectors.

881
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:04,800
Now, the thing
that we like to do

882
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:09,420
is to move this
factor to that side.

883
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:13,650
How do you move a factor on the
first input to the other input?

884
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:16,600
You take the adjoint.

885
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,660
So I should move
it with an adjoint.

886
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,370
So what do I get?

887
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:31,210
Psi, and then I get the
adjoint and this factor again.

888
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:44,320
Now, I should put a dagger
here, but let me not put it,

889
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:47,990
because A is Hermitian.

890
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:53,800
And moreover, expectation
value of A is real.

891
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:57,140
Remember-- so no
need for the dagger,

892
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:58,920
so you can put the
dagger, and then

893
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,290
explain that this is
Hermitian and this is real--

894
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:05,910
or just not put it.

895
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:08,700
And now look at this.

896
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,580
This is a typical calculation.

897
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:12,255
You'll do it many, many times.

898
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:18,440
You just spread out the things.

899
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,800
So let me just do it once.

900
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:27,360
Here you get A squared minus
A expectation value of A minus

901
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:32,960
expectation value of
A A plus expectation

902
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,135
value of A squared psi.

903
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:44,850
So I multiplied everything,
but you shouldn't be all

904
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:49,820
that-- I should put
a 1 here, probably--

905
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:51,450
shouldn't worry about this much.

906
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:54,850
This is just a number and
an A, a number and an A.

907
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:56,010
The order doesn't matter.

908
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:59,120
These two terms are
really the same.

909
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:04,520
Well, let me go
slowly on this once.

910
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,020
What is the first term?

911
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:09,770
It's psi A squared psi, so
it's the expectation value

912
01:08:09,770 --> 01:08:12,870
of A squared.

913
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:15,260
Now, what is this term?

914
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:18,960
Well, you have a number
here, which is real.

915
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,220
It goes out of whatever you're
doing, and you have psi A psi.

916
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:26,090
So this is expectation
value of A.

917
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:28,590
And from the leftover
psi A psi, you

918
01:08:28,590 --> 01:08:36,640
get another expectation
value of A. So this is A A.

919
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,430
Here the same thing--
the number goes out,

920
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:42,220
and you're left with
a psi A psi, which

921
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:49,010
is another expectation value
of A, so you get minus A A.

922
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:53,430
And you have a plus
expectation value of A squared.

923
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:56,890
And I don't need the i anymore,
because the expectation values

924
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:58,490
have been taken.

925
01:08:58,490 --> 01:09:00,689
And this always happens.

926
01:09:00,689 --> 01:09:03,920
It's a minus here, a
minus here, and a plus

927
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,964
here, so there's just one
minus at the end of the day.

928
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:21,529
One minus at the end of the
day, and a familiar, or famous

929
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:31,779
formula comes out that
delta of A on psi squared

930
01:09:31,779 --> 01:09:36,250
is equal to the expectation
value of A squared minus

931
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:41,420
expectation value of A squared.

932
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:44,430
Which shows something
quite powerful.

933
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:48,120
This has connections, of course,
with statistical mechanics

934
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:49,193
and standard deviations.

935
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,390
It's a probabilistic
interpretation of this formula,

936
01:09:56,390 --> 01:10:00,940
but one fact that this
has allowed us to prove

937
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:04,050
is that the expectation
value of A squared

938
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:06,550
is always greater
or equal than that,

939
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:10,380
because this number is
positive, because it

940
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:13,670
is the square of a
real positive number.

941
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:17,610
So that's a slightly
non-trivial thing,

942
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:19,256
and it's good to know it.

943
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:26,380
And this formula, of
course, is very well known.

944
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:36,030
Now, I'm going to leave a funny
geometrical interpretation

945
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:37,020
of the uncertainty.

946
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:40,110
Maybe you will find
it illuminating,

947
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,580
in some ways turning
into pictures

948
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:45,460
all these calculations
we've done.

949
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:48,460
I think it actually
adds value to it,

950
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:52,680
and I don't think
it's very well known,

951
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:57,380
or it's kind of funny, because
it must not be very well known.

952
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:01,630
But maybe people don't
find it that suggestive.

953
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:04,020
I kind of find it suggestive.

954
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:09,550
So here's what I want
to say geometrically.

955
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:12,110
You have this vector space,
and you have a vector psi.

956
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:22,180
Then you come along, and
you add with the operator

957
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:27,890
A. Now the fact that
this thing is not

958
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:32,510
and eigenstate means that
after you add with A,

959
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:35,500
you don't keep in
the same direction.

960
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,180
You go in different directions.

961
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:41,670
So here is A psi.

962
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:50,630
So what can we say here?

963
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:55,700
Well, actually
here is this thing.

964
01:11:55,700 --> 01:12:00,030
Think of this vector
space spanned by psi.

965
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:06,850
Let's call it U psi.

966
01:12:06,850 --> 01:12:10,860
So it's that line there.

967
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:16,680
You can project this
in here, orthogonally.

968
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:27,030
Here is the first
claim-- the vector

969
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:30,130
that you get up to
here-- this vector-- is

970
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:37,210
nothing else but expectation
value of A times psi.

971
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:40,140
And that makes sense, because
it's a number times psi.

972
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:44,120
But precisely the orthogonal
projection is this.

973
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,850
And here, you get an
orthogonal vector.

974
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:48,740
We'll call it psi perp.

975
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:56,000
And the funny thing
about this psi perp

976
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,863
is that its length is
precisely the uncertainty.

977
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:12,220
So all this, but you could
prove-- I'm going to do it.

978
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:14,220
I'm going to show you all
these things are true,

979
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:16,550
but it gives you a
bit of an insight.

980
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:17,870
you have a vector.

981
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:19,980
A moves you out.

982
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:24,524
What is the uncertainty is
this vertical projection--

983
01:13:24,524 --> 01:13:25,940
vertical thing is
the uncertainty.

984
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:30,560
If you're down there,
you get nothing.

985
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:35,130
So how do we prove that?

986
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:41,440
Well, let's
construct a projector

987
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:49,440
down to the space U
psi, which is psi psi.

988
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:56,880
This is a projector,
just like any e1.

989
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,660
e1 is a projection into
the direction of 1.

990
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:04,450
Well, take your first
basis vector to be psi,

991
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:07,310
and that's a projection to psi.

992
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:11,950
So let's see what it--
so the projection to psi.

993
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:15,600
So now let's see
what it gives you

994
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:24,390
when it acts on A psi--
this project acting on A psi

995
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:31,120
is equal to psi psi A psi.

996
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,590
And again, the usefulness
of bracket notation

997
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:38,400
is kind of nice here.

998
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,310
So what is this?

999
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:44,780
The expectation value of A. So
indeed psi expectation value

1000
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:49,870
of A is what you get when
you project this down.

1001
01:15:00,882 --> 01:15:05,550
So then, the rest
is sort of simple.

1002
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:13,885
If you take psi, and
subtract from psi-- well,

1003
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:31,360
I'll subtract from psi, psi
times expectation value of A.

1004
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,270
I'm sorry, I was
saying it wrong.

1005
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:41,040
If you think the
original vector-- A psi,

1006
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:45,520
and subtract from
it what we took out,

1007
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:50,610
which is psi times expectation
value of A, the projected

1008
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:53,840
thing-- this is some vector.

1009
01:15:53,840 --> 01:16:01,880
But the main thing is that this
vector is orthogonal to psi.

1010
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:02,630
Why?

1011
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:09,450
If you take a psi on the left,
this is orthogonal to psi.

1012
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:10,830
And how do you see it?

1013
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:13,980
Put the psi from the left.

1014
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:15,340
And what do you get here?

1015
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:19,180
Psi A psi, which is
expectation value of A,

1016
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:23,840
psi psi, which is 1, and
expectation value A is 0.

1017
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:30,110
So this is a vector psi perp.

1018
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:35,280
And this is, of course,
A minus expectation value

1019
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:40,270
of A acting on the state psi.

1020
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:46,300
Well, precisely the norm of
psi perp is the norm of this,

1021
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,510
but that's what we defined
to be the uncertainty.

1022
01:16:51,830 --> 01:17:04,840
So indeed, the norm of psi
perp is delta A of psi.

1023
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:09,230
So our ideas of projectors
and orthogonal projectors

1024
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:11,340
allow you to
understand better what

1025
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:14,010
is the uncertainty--
more pictorially.

1026
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:18,080
You have pictures of vectors,
and orthogonal projections,

1027
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,550
and you want to make
the uncertainty 0,

1028
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:24,010
you have to push
the A psi into psi.

1029
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:28,160
You have to be an
eigenstate, and you're there.

1030
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:31,430
Now, the last thing of-- I'll
use the last five minutes

1031
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:37,965
to motivate the uncertainty,
the famous uncertainty theorem.

1032
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:01,470
And typically, the
uncertainly theorem

1033
01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:09,460
is useful for A and B--
two Hermitian operators.

1034
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:22,250
And it relates the uncertainty
in A on the state psi

1035
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:27,570
to the uncertainty
in B of psi, saying

1036
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:31,535
it must be greater than
or equal than some number.

1037
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:42,600
Now, if you look
at that, and you

1038
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:46,580
think of all the math
we've been talking about,

1039
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:49,870
you maybe know
exactly how you're

1040
01:18:49,870 --> 01:18:51,860
supposed to prove the
uncertainty theorem.

1041
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:00,070
Well, what does
this remind you of?

1042
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:05,750
Cauchy-Schwarz--
Schwarz inequality,

1043
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:08,350
I'm sorry-- not Cauchy-Schwarz.

1044
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:08,850
Why?

1045
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:16,870
Because for Schwarz inequality,
you have norm of u, norm of v

1046
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:21,600
is greater than or equal than
the norm of the inner product

1047
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:29,290
of u and v-- absolute value of
the inner product of u and v.

1048
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:31,660
Remember, in this thing,
this is norm of a vector,

1049
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:34,910
this is norm of a vector, and
this is value of a scalar.

1050
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:42,160
And our uncertainties are norms.

1051
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,720
So it better be that.

1052
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,640
That inequality is
the only inequality

1053
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,800
that can possibly
give you the answer.

1054
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:54,500
So how would you set this up?

1055
01:19:54,500 --> 01:20:04,990
You would say define-- as we'll
say f equal A minus A acting

1056
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:15,060
on psi, and g is equal to
B minus B acting on psi.

1057
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:25,730
And then f f, or f f
is delta A squared.

1058
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:32,806
f g g is delta B squared.

1059
01:20:37,730 --> 01:20:42,090
And you just need to compute
the inner product of f g,

1060
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:44,330
because you need the mixed one.

1061
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:48,420
So if you want to
have fun, try it.

1062
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:50,380
We'll do it next time anyway.

1063
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:53,600
All right that's it for today.
