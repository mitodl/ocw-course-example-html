8
00:00:21,275 --> 00:00:22,150
PROFESSOR: Very good.

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,960
So today, we'll
begin with a study

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,360
of one dimensional potentials
and the energy eigenstates

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,150
or properties.

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:39,190
And we'll discuss this for
about half of the lecture.

13
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:44,700
And then go into the
variational principle.

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,490
So let me go back then to
our discussion of last time,

15
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,960
where we were talking
about energy eigenstates

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,040
and the Schrodinger
equation in one dimension.

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,330
So there's a term that
we use all the time.

18
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,850
This term is called
the bound state.

19
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:06,160
And bound state seems something
sort of very non-trivial.

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,650
But mathematically, we can
say quite clearly what it is.

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,610
A bound state is
something that is not

22
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,500
spread all over
space, basically.

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,120
And the way we therefore use
the terminology for bound

24
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,010
state it that we only
speak of bound states

25
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,420
when there are
energy eigenstates.

26
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,500
So an energy eigenstate may
or may not be a bound state,

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,380
but any bound state is
an energy eigenstate.

28
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,330
So an energy eigenstate
is a bound state

29
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,710
if the wave function
goes to zero

30
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,400
when you go
sufficiently far away.

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,710
So it's a simple
definition, but it

32
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,710
helps us understand
that the basic idea is

33
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,480
at the state is just not
spread all over the world.

34
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,240
Now remember we're trying
to find energy eigenstates,

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,020
and that is to find
wave functions, time

36
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,920
independent wave functions,
that solve the time

37
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,350
independent
Schrodinger equation.

38
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,889
Which I have written
there for convenience.

39
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,110
This is the same equation
we wrote last time.

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,500
For a time
independent potential,

41
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,880
so that the full
wave function can

42
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,760
be written as a
phase that contains

43
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,590
the information of the
energy times a function of x,

44
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,280
sine of x.

45
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,210
That still may be complex, but
it doesn't have to be complex.

46
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,355
As you can see, this
is a real equation.

47
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,010
Now in order to clean up some of
the constants in this equation,

48
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,146
it's-- yes?

49
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:49,257
AUDIENCE: Why is
it not V x minus e?

50
00:02:49,257 --> 00:02:51,590
PROFESSOR: Well you have to
look back at the Schrodinger

51
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,680
equation, and bring the
things to the other side,

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,330
and take care of the signs.

53
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,250
It is correct as stated.

54
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:00,965
Check it.

55
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:10,580
Now we have, in order
to do this and just

56
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,930
to write things with
a little more clarity,

57
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,580
we scale the energy.

58
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,590
So we define a
calligraphic energy,

59
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:33,140
which is 2m over h squared times
energy E. And a calligraphic V

60
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,100
with the same scaling factor.

61
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,820
So that the Schrodinger
equation then takes the form--

62
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,170
this same equation-- sine.

63
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:53,200
And I'll use the double prime
notation for two derivatives.

64
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:03,250
Plus now E minus cal
of x sine equals zero.

65
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,890
So this is how our
equation looks.

66
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,030
It's relatively simple.

67
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,920
And can be treated
without carrying constants

68
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,120
all over the place.

69
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,200
Now we're going to
discuss a few results that

70
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,120
are extremely important that
you keep in mind for the future.

71
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,550
It helps you think clearly.

72
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,360
So these results are
little theorems that I'm

73
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,080
going to state.

74
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,980
And the proofs are
given in the notes.

75
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,500
I will skip some of
the proofs, although I

76
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,630
will tell you what the
strategy is for the proofs

77
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,950
and then show how
the theorem implies,

78
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,370
as a corollary,
interesting things that

79
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,110
could easily be misconstrued.

80
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,890
So let me give you
the first theorem.

81
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,700
Theorem one.

82
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,110
This is just the
statement that if you

83
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,070
are talking about bound states
in one dimensional potentials,

84
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,720
there are no degeneracies.

85
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,080
So let's write it.

86
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:33,190
There is no degeneracy
for bound states of one

87
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,840
dimensional potentials.

88
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,030
So it's a fundamental result.

89
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,080
We'll see some way to
understand it a little later.

90
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,650
And you have seen this
in 804, I believe.

91
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,610
So what is a
strategy to a proof?

92
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,760
So we want a rigorous proof.

93
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,490
So what is a strategy?

94
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,380
I will not go through the proof.

95
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,280
The strategy is to assume
there is a degeneracy.

96
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:18,426
So strategy, assume
a degeneracy.

97
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:35,930
So sine 1 and sine 2 different
with the same energy.

98
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:43,180
And then you write this
equation for sine 1 and sine 2,

99
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,600
and they have the same energy.

100
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,360
Then you take the two equations,
and you multiply the first

101
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,390
by something, the
second by another thing.

102
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,640
Subtract it.

103
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,340
Do a bit of algebra.

104
00:06:53,340 --> 00:07:02,640
And you suddenly can
prove that one solution

105
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,490
is equal to a constant
times the other solution.

106
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,890
So you do the work, and
that's what comes out.

107
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:19,290
Once you've shown that one
is proportional to the other,

108
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,820
we've declared in
quantum mechanics

109
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,030
that two wave functions
that differ by a constant

110
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,580
have exactly the same physics.

111
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,130
You can normalize it,
and normalize them.

112
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,030
And the constant
can be just a phase,

113
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,540
but the phase doesn't matter.

114
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,130
So those two wave functions
are really the same.

115
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,610
So you get a contradiction.

116
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,420
You thought they were different.

117
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,770
But the difference
is just too trivial,

118
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,610
and therefore they are really
the same wave function.

119
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,950
Because we've said that
two wave functions that

120
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,190
differ by a constant
should be identified.

121
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,410
So that's this theorem.

122
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,640
And it's a key theorem.

123
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,470
Let's go to the next theorem
that is also important.

124
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,733
So theorem two.

125
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:31,185
Energy eigenstates sine f of
x can be chosen to be real.

126
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,850
So here it is.

127
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,650
We mentioned that this
differential equation

128
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,980
allows for real solutions.

129
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,360
There's no contradiction,
because there's no i in there.

130
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,090
But now we say more.

131
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,660
That even if you find
a complex solution,

132
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,070
you can work with
real solutions.

133
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,590
So what is the strategy here?

134
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,990
Again strategy.

135
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,005
To have you get a
complex solution.

136
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Sine f of x.

137
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,520
And then you go about
to prove that actually

138
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,240
this complex solution
implies the existence of two

139
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,160
real solutions.

140
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:42,200
So this complex solution
implies existence

141
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,780
of two real solutions.

142
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,960
And moreover, two real-- I
should say it better here--

143
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,450
degenerate solutions.

144
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,470
How could you prove that?

145
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,010
Well, it probably
would occur to you

146
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,910
that you would take a solution
and say, oh, this solves it.

147
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,940
Then you would show that sine
star also solves this equation.

148
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,870
And then by linearity of
the Schrodinger equation,

149
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,270
you could form what we would
call the real solution formed

150
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:30,980
by taking sine plus sine
star and adding them.

151
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:37,450
Or the real solution that
comes from the imaginary part.

152
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:42,380
You see the real and imaginary
parts of a complex number

153
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,920
are real.

154
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,490
So is the case here as well.

155
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:51,180
That they can take sine and
sine star that are different.

156
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,930
And the sum is real
by construction.

157
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,700
You put the star, and
recalling that star of star

158
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,400
gives nothing, you see that this
function is equal to its star.

159
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,880
So it's real.

160
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,370
So is this one.

161
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,750
This function, which is the
imaginary part of the solution

162
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,760
that you had, is also real.

163
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,270
So you get two real solutions.

164
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,850
Moreover, you can show
that sine and sine star

165
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,100
have the same energy.

166
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,780
Therefore sine r and sine
m have the same energy.

167
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,770
So I'm really
skipping very little.

168
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,940
But I don't want to
clutter the blackboard

169
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,340
with the whole derivation
at this moment.

170
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,825
So here is the strategy.

171
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:47,790
A complex solution implies
two real solutions.

172
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,480
And therefore, since
you have real solutions,

173
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,160
you can always choose
them to be real.

174
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,740
No loss of generality.

175
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,560
You had a complex solution.

176
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,870
You say, I like
just real solutions.

177
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,700
And you chose your
two real solutions.

178
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,600
You give them.

179
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,850
You've given the whole thing.

180
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,570
But then there is
a nice corollary

181
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,370
for the case of one
dimension bound states.

182
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:20,590
So this is the part that is
perhaps somewhat interesting.

183
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,070
And the corollary
is that if you're

184
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:29,530
talking bound states
of one dimension,

185
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:37,970
any solution is equal to a
real solution up to a constant.

186
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,980
You may say, well
what's the difference?

187
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,970
Let's write it down
and look at it.

188
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:58,480
Corollary for bound states of
one dimensional potentials.

189
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:23,940
Any solution is, up to a phase,
equal to a real solution.

190
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:37,840
So how does that go?

191
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,580
Maybe we can use more
of this blackboard.

192
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,710
Why would any solution
be, up to a phase,

193
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,020
equal to a real solution?

194
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,340
OK.

195
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,870
Suppose you have these
two solutions here.

196
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,592
Well this is real, so
that's trivially true.

197
00:13:55,592 --> 00:13:56,300
And this is real.

198
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,270
But what if I put a linear
combination of them?

199
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,620
Or take the original
complex solution?

200
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,880
Why would it be, up to a phase,
equal to a real solution?

201
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,800
The answer is the following.

202
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,470
Because of theorem and,
that there's no degeneracy,

203
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:17,180
you've got two
solutions that claim

204
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,840
to be different and degenerate.

205
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,890
But that can't be.

206
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:31,550
So by theorem one, you must
have that-- in the notations,

207
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:36,310
I have here-- sine
imaginary of x

208
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:41,245
must be equal to a constant
times sine real of x.

209
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:54,960
Now if these function's
anyway are real,

210
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,120
the constant here must be real.

211
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,630
Therefore, even if you form
the original complex solution,

212
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:14,501
sine, which is sine real
plus i sine imaginary.

213
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:16,470
You can check that.

214
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,940
It's clear by definition that
that's the way it should be.

215
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:25,350
If you think this, this
is equal to 1 plus i times

216
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:30,860
c times sine real of x.

217
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,940
Therefore this is equal
to a constant times

218
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,250
the phase of-- this
is a complex number.

219
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,070
So this is yet another
constant that we

220
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:52,000
could say, the norm of 1 plus
i c times some phase times sine

221
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,460
r of x.

222
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:58,000
So you see that any solution,
any linear combination,

223
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,080
in fact, with any numbers of
sine r and sine imaginary,

224
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,760
will be a constant times
a phase times this thing.

225
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,020
So it is really
just real anyway.

226
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,455
So you can just
have one solution.

227
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:19,950
And any solution
that you may write,

228
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,960
that represents a bound
state, is, up to a phase,

229
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,115
equal to a real solution.

230
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:30,780
OK.

231
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,690
So that's our theorem two.

232
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,760
Theorem three.

233
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,980
It's also very famous.

234
00:16:47,980 --> 00:17:01,640
If the potential V of x is
even-- that is, V of minus x

235
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:14,089
is equal to V of x-- the
eigenstate can be chosen

236
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:26,730
to be even or odd
under x2 minus x.

237
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,220
OK.

238
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:39,040
So here is another claim.

239
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,480
So the potential is even.

240
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,210
There's no theorem for
all the potentials.

241
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,170
No clear theorems, no simple
theorems for all the--

242
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,580
but if the potential
is even, the claim

243
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,280
is that you can choose
eigenstates to be even or odd.

244
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,460
The word chosen is
very important here.

245
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,800
Otherwise, this would not
be a precise statement.

246
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,160
You cannot say the
eigenstates are even or odd.

247
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,400
You can choose them to be.

248
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,460
So how does the proof go?

249
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:18,200
Strategy begin with
a wave function,

250
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,840
sine of x, that is
neither even nor odd.

251
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,580
And then you do a little work
with the Schrodinger equation.

252
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,630
Take the Schrodinger
equation, change all x's

253
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:42,180
to minus x's and show that,
in fact, not only is sine

254
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:48,640
of x a solution, but sine of
minus x is also a solution.

255
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,720
With the same energy.

256
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:58,250
So prove that sine of
minus x is a solution

257
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,220
with the same energy.

258
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:12,550
And in this case, of
course, we can already

259
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,090
have shown that we
can choose these wave

260
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,470
functions to be real.

261
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,520
So we can choose all of these
wave functions to be real.

262
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,040
And what do we do next?

263
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,200
If we have these two solutions
with the same energy,

264
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,710
then you can build
of sine s, which

265
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,800
is 1/2 of sine of x
plus sine of minus x.

266
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,200
And of sine a.

267
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,500
s for symmetric, and
a for anti-symmetric.

268
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,750
And of sine a,
that is 1/2 of sine

269
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:57,900
of x minus sine of minus x.

270
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,930
And this tool
would be this even,

271
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,260
under the exchange
of x for minus x.

272
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:12,350
This one odd, under the
exchange of x for minus x.

273
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,700
And both would be
solutions by superposition.

274
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,805
And both would have
the same energy.

275
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:29,400
So that's the end of the theorem
because then these things are

276
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,640
even or odd and have
the same energy.

277
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,300
So the solutions can be chosen
to be even or odd under x.

278
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,120
So if you've proven this,
you've got it already.

279
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,805
But now we get the corollary.

280
00:20:49,490 --> 00:21:01,660
For bound states
in one dimension,

281
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,900
the solutions not
anymore the word chosen.

282
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,710
We can delete the word chosen.

283
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:13,465
The solutions are
either odd or even.

284
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,810
So it's a lot stronger.

285
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,380
It's not anymore, you
can choose them to be,

286
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,981
but a general one is
neither odd nor even.

287
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:36,480
No.

288
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,660
You try to find the solution
that is neither odd nor even,

289
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,800
and you can't find it.

290
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,930
So it's very strong.

291
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,216
Yes?

292
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:46,070
AUDIENCE: Is this
for even potentials?

293
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,195
PROFESSOR: Even potentials.

294
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:47,970
Yes.

295
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,980
For bound states in one
dimension with even potentials.

296
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,255
V of x.

297
00:21:54,255 --> 00:21:56,770
V of minus x equal V of x.

298
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,940
Yes.

299
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,720
So how do we show that?

300
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,500
Well, again, you've
got two solutions here

301
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,750
that are degenerate that
have the same energy.

302
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,730
Sine of x and sine of minus x.

303
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,780
So given that there's
no degeneracy in one

304
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,620
dimensional problems, this thing
that they have the same energy,

305
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,950
the only thing that
can be happening

306
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:30,400
is that sine of minus x is equal
to a constant times sine of x.

307
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,670
Where this constant is real.

308
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,630
Why real?

309
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,590
Because we said already
by the previously theorem,

310
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,590
wave functions can
be chosen to be real.

311
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:45,930
So you've got this thing
already that this is true.

312
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:51,670
Sine of minus x is equal
to c times sine of x.

313
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,040
Which, if you use this
property again by saying,

314
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:03,400
oh, but sine of x is equal
to c times sine of minus x.

315
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,100
Basically, what this says
is that you can change

316
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,480
the sign of the argument
by putting an extra c.

317
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,530
So you do it again, sine
of x is equal to this.

318
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:18,820
So this is c squared
times sine of minus x.

319
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,580
So c squared must be equal to 1.

320
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,290
And therefore c is equal
to either plus or minus 1.

321
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,030
No other option.

322
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:35,060
So the functions are
either even or odd,

323
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,750
but they can't be arbitrary.

324
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,270
This point is
sufficiently settled

325
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,760
that part two
general exam at MIT

326
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,910
10 years ago had a
question like that.

327
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,700
And the person that
invented the problem

328
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,990
claimed that there
would be a solution that

329
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,580
could be neither even nor odd.

330
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,530
So even faculty members at
MIT sometimes get this wrong.

331
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:06,260
It's not as weak as
this, that can be chosen.

332
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,247
But it's really either
or other in the case

333
00:24:11,247 --> 00:24:12,205
you have one dimension.

334
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,630
OK.

335
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:20,730
So these are our main theorems.

336
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,670
And we're going to
proceed now by clarifying

337
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,090
a little more the
nature of the spectrum.

338
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,225
So are there questions?

339
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,180
Yes?

340
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,930
AUDIENCE: Can you give
an example of state

341
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,857
that's not bound?

342
00:24:36,857 --> 00:24:37,440
PROFESSOR: OK.

343
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,220
The question is can
I give an example

344
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,870
of a state that is not bound?

345
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:43,700
Yes.

346
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,310
We can give such state.

347
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,990
You have a potential like this.

348
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,350
And you have an
energy like that.

349
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,920
And then the wave function
could look like this.

350
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,940
Then do something like that.

351
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,260
And then look like that.

352
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,637
It just doesn't vanish
when you go to infinity.

353
00:25:02,637 --> 00:25:04,220
AUDIENCE: So that
can't be normalized?

354
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,640
PROFESSOR: Can't be normalized.

355
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,230
That's right.

356
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,980
If it's not bound, it
can't be normalized.

357
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,212
Other questions?

358
00:25:16,212 --> 00:25:17,156
Yes?

359
00:25:17,156 --> 00:25:20,932
AUDIENCE: So you can't really
represent-- it's doesn't really

360
00:25:20,932 --> 00:25:24,250
represent single particles,
more like a stream of particles?

361
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:24,900
PROFESSOR: Yes.

362
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,680
So it doesn't represent
a single particle.

363
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,550
Now trying to interpret it
as a stream of particles

364
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,990
is a little delicate.

365
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,320
So what we usually do is
we build superpositions

366
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,160
of those states that can
represent a localized thing.

367
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,130
But it's true that,
morally speaking,

368
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:49,370
it seems to represent
more than one particle.

369
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,510
OK.

370
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,950
So now we talk a little about
the nature of the spectrum.

371
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:12,040
So what do we want to say here?

372
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,210
We want to go back to the
Schrodinger equation here.

373
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:21,050
And just move one term
to the right hand side.

374
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:24,160
And just see what
can happen in terms

375
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,860
of singularities
and discontinuities.

376
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:40,040
So first of all, we
always begin with the idea

377
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,840
that sine must be continuous.

378
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,060
And the reason sine
must be continuous is

379
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:53,930
that we don't want
singularities worse

380
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:57,110
than delta functions
in potentials.

381
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:03,010
If a function is
continuous, the derivative

382
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:06,170
might be discontinuous,
and the second derivative

383
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,760
would have a delta function.

384
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,540
So the second derivative
would have a delta function.

385
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,760
But if the function is
not even continuous,

386
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,480
the second derivative would have
derivatives of delta functions.

387
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,230
So somehow the potential
would have to have that.

388
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,570
And we don't want it.

389
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:27,206
So to simplify our life, we say
that sine must be continuous.

390
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:39,060
Now if sine is
continuous, we will

391
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:44,850
consider several possibilities,
possibilities for V,

392
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:51,370
possibilities for V of x.

393
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,715
So first possibility--
one, V is continuous.

394
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,910
So psi is continuous,
and V is continuous.

395
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,200
If psi is continuous
and V is continuous,

396
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,610
this product is continuous.

397
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,230
Psi double prime is continuous.

398
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,230
And psi prime is continuous.

399
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,810
Two, V has finite jumps.

400
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:35,830
Well, if V has finite jumps,
and psi is continuous,

401
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:39,590
this product has finite jumps.

402
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:44,760
So psi double prime
has finite jumps.

403
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,360
If psi prime has
finite jumps, the worst

404
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,715
is that psi prime still
must be continuous.

405
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,410
But it changes.

406
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,520
Psi prime could look like
that, could have a corner.

407
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,620
But it cannot be
worse than that.

408
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:10,970
Because if V has finite
jumps, if psi double

409
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:15,025
prime has finite jumps, and if
psi prime is not continuous,

410
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:16,880
it would have delta functions.

411
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,110
So for these two conditions,
continuous or even

412
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:27,760
finite jumps, psi prime
is still continuous.

413
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,250
Things change qualitatively if
three, V has delta functions.

414
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:44,050
If V has a delta
function, then psi

415
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:47,670
double prime has
a delta function.

416
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:52,410
And psi prime therefore jumps.

417
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,400
Psi prime is not continuous.

418
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,860
Psi prime jumps.

419
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,090
This may be reminiscent
to you whenever

420
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,290
you had to solve the
problem of a bound state

421
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,510
of a delta function,
you got a wave function

422
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:10,220
that looked like this in
which psi prime jumps.

423
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,520
And it has to jump.

424
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,970
Because psi double prime
has a delta function.

425
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:19,940
Another case in
which psi prime jumps

426
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,450
is for if V has a hard wall.

427
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:30,835
That is, the potential suddenly
at one point becomes infinite,

428
00:30:30,835 --> 00:30:34,970
and it prevents the
particle from moving across.

429
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:38,470
A hard wall is a
place, as you remember

430
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,350
in the infinite square
well, in which the wave

431
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:44,890
function vanishes, but the
derivative doesn't vanish.

432
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:49,370
So you could say that
psi is 0 here outside.

433
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:55,160
Psi prime, then, jumps
in that it's non-0 here

434
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,960
and it's 0 afterwards.

435
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,850
So now, you could
object to what I'm

436
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,730
saying by explaining that,
well, we shouldn't talk

437
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,950
about the wave function
beyond the hard wall.

438
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,010
And in some sense, you're right.

439
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,850
But suppose we do and we say
the wave function is just

440
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,390
0 everywhere, we see
that psi prime jumps.

441
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:23,640
So really, psi prime jumps.

442
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,250
So this is as bad
as things can get.

443
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:33,570
So we can summarize this
in just one sentence.

444
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:39,390
And the sentence reads,
psi and psi prime

445
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:57,510
are continuous unless V has
delta functions or hard walls,

446
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:07,120
in which case psi prime
can have finite jumps.

447
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,770
So basically, psi and
psi prime, continuous.

448
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:25,850
Exceptions-- delta functions
and hard walls, and psi prime

449
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,200
can change.

450
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,860
So questions.

451
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,292
There was a question before.

452
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:33,250
Maybe it's still there.

453
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:33,860
Yes.

454
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,668
AUDIENCE: Do you absolutely
need that function [INAUDIBLE]?

455
00:32:37,668 --> 00:32:40,980
Or do we just assume
that [INAUDIBLE]?

456
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,150
PROFESSOR: We assume it--
so the question is, do I

457
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:46,960
need that in absolute generality
to do quantum mechanics?

458
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,440
I don't think so.

459
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,185
I presume you could discuss
some potentials that

460
00:32:53,185 --> 00:32:56,610
lead to psi that
are not continuous

461
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,640
and still make sense.

462
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,320
But we will not discuss them.

463
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,495
And actually, I don't think
I've encountered any of those.

464
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:08,326
Yes.

465
00:33:08,326 --> 00:33:09,700
AUDIENCE: Can you
give an example

466
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,015
of a physical system whose
potential is well approximated

467
00:33:12,015 --> 00:33:13,348
by a delta function [INAUDIBLE]?

468
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:24,540
PROFESSOR: Yes, there
are systems like that.

469
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:28,450
For example, this one
that is somewhat well

470
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,790
approximated by
a delta function.

471
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:34,000
For example, a
nucleus sometimes is

472
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,990
considered to be like a
spherical cavity in which

473
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:42,470
particles are bound by a deep
potential and don't escape.

474
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,250
So the nuclei are moving
like that and don't escape.

475
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,030
In that case, it would be
a three dimensional delta

476
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:53,410
function that vanishes
at the origin.

477
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:56,070
I presume there
are many examples.

478
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,560
Any potential that
sort of begins

479
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,850
like a finite square well
that is sufficiently deep

480
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:07,235
will start to look like a
delta function after awhile.

481
00:34:07,235 --> 00:34:08,110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

482
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:17,929
PROFESSOR: Well, it's again
neither-- yeah, I guess so.

483
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:21,719
But it depends how
big is this psi.

484
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:26,050
So yeah, probably you're right.

485
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:29,960
This looks a little more like
an analog of a hard wall.

486
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,690
But if a hard wall is
very narrow and very deep,

487
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,300
it looks like a delta function.

488
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,090
So it's idealizations for sure.

489
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:42,310
But I'm sure we could
get a better example.

490
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:45,580
And I'll try to find one.

491
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,310
Now, the next
thing we want to do

492
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:52,800
is give you intuition for
this incredible result

493
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,380
that there's no degeneratives
in one dimensional potentials.

494
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:02,450
That is not to say that the
proof is not good enough.

495
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:07,440
It is just to say that
we can illustrate that

496
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,920
without going into a
mathematical proof that

497
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,010
is more complicated.

498
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,970
So how do we do that?

499
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,980
We'll consider the following
case, a simple case,

500
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:23,670
an example of a
potential of this form.

501
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,260
V of x-- this is x.

502
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,800
And here is V of x.

503
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:36,410
And we will try to find a
solution with some energy that

504
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:42,780
is like that, an energy that is
right there below the barrier.

505
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,720
So this would be a bound state.

506
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,520
Why?

507
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,332
Because solutions
here are exponentials

508
00:35:52,332 --> 00:35:54,820
that decay,
exponentials that decay.

509
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,500
And here, the wave
function would

510
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,970
be oscillating presumably.

511
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,900
So the wave functions
go to 0 and infinity.

512
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,190
You could get a bound state.

513
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,150
So let's see how we
get a bound state.

514
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,970
Now, the argument
I'm going to follow

515
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,110
is just an elaboration
of something

516
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,450
you can read in Shankar.

517
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:16,900
And it's a nice and
simple argument.

518
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:24,000
So we want to understand why we
would get here no degeneracies.

519
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,440
Or even more-- in fact
not just no degeneracies,

520
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,050
but the spectrum is quantized.

521
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,710
That is, you find one energy,
and then another energy maybe,

522
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,730
and another energy.

523
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,590
So how do we see that?

524
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:43,690
Well, you look at the way
you can write solutions

525
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,750
and count the parameters
of the solutions

526
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,980
and try to see how many
conditions you have to satisfy.

527
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,980
So here, the wave function
would be a decay in exponential.

528
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,160
A decay in exponential
is of the form

529
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:06,040
alpha e to the K, kappa, x.

530
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,730
Because x here is negative.

531
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,260
So this decays as x
goes to minus infinity

532
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,810
if kappa is positive.

533
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,170
And that's how a solution looks.

534
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:19,140
You need one coefficient here
to determine this solutions.

535
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,604
So I'll put a 1 here.

536
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,650
Now, in here, the
solution is oscillatory.

537
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,012
So it's a sine plus cosine.

538
00:37:29,012 --> 00:37:30,220
So you need two coefficients.

539
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,930
In here, the solution
must again be decaying.

540
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,810
And therefore, you just
need one coefficient.

541
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:45,150
Again, this time it would
be a beta e to the minus Kx.

542
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,870
The fact that this
potential looks

543
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:50,350
symmetric-- I'm
not assuming it is.

544
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:50,920
Yes.

545
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,544
AUDIENCE: Won't one
of the coefficients

546
00:37:52,544 --> 00:37:53,960
be unconstrained
by normalization?

547
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,160
Isn't one just the
normalization factor?

548
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,720
PROFESSOR: OK, how
about normalization?

549
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,600
Indeed, we have one,
two, and two and one, so

550
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,230
a total of four coefficients,
four parameters.

551
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,710
But indeed, suppose you
wrote your whole solution.

552
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:21,800
You could say, look, let me
divide this solution by 3.

553
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,460
That's an equivalent solution.

554
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,350
I'm just checking if it solves
the Schrodinger equation.

555
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,520
That's all I have to check.

556
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,910
I don't have to
check normalization.

557
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:34,870
Normalization, in fact, is
sort of irrelevant here.

558
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:37,040
You just need to know
if a bound state exists.

559
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,200
So indeed, even though you have
these four parameters, given

560
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,670
that you can multiply the
solution by a constant,

561
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:51,455
there's just three
constants to fix.

562
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:58,660
Four parameters
via normalization

563
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,540
or the multiplication by
any constant-- just three

564
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,050
constants to fix.

565
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,910
But this potential
is nice enough

566
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,760
that psi and psi prime
must be continuous.

567
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,690
So you get two conditions
here and two conditions here.

568
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:19,680
So four conditions-- continuity
of psi and psi prime,

569
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,650
continuity of psi and psi
prime, four conditions.

570
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,730
So what did we get?

571
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,120
We got in trouble.

572
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:34,700
We've shown that this is
unsolvable in general.

573
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,990
Because there are more
conditions than parameters.

574
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,350
Now, this equation could
to be a little peculiar.

575
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,330
Maybe this is not
completely general.

576
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:47,810
But you seem to have more
conditions than parameters.

577
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:51,210
But here comes the catch.

578
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:55,830
The solution really
is determined.

579
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,670
Like kappa-- do you know kappa?

580
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:02,960
Well, you know kappa if you
know the energy of the solution.

581
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,210
Kappa is determined by the
energy of the solution.

582
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:08,890
So some parameters in the
solution depend on the energy.

583
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:12,150
So the way we have
to think of this

584
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:16,220
is that in fact three constants
to fix, but four conditions.

585
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,510
So we really need
four constants to fix.

586
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:22,090
And the fourth
constant is the energy.

587
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,980
So the energy is the
fourth constant to fix.

588
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:28,040
And with four conditions,
these three constants

589
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,450
that we had there and the
energy, they can just be fixed.

590
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:35,670
So the solution
should fix the energy

591
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:39,080
and should fix this coefficient.

592
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:50,820
So the solution exists for
some energy, or possibly

593
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,560
some values of the energies, but
not all values of the energy.

594
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,030
So this shows, or at least
very clearly illustrates,

595
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:04,310
that you are going to find sets
of energies for which you have

596
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:08,030
solutions depending on
how the equations look,

597
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,920
and one solution each time.

598
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:17,466
So you get what is called
a discrete non-degenerate

599
00:41:17,466 --> 00:41:17,965
spectrum.

600
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,110
Now, there are more
cases to discuss,

601
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,630
the case in which you
have just the step,

602
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:35,540
or the case in which you
have three bound states.

603
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:43,340
And I will not do them
but state the results.

604
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,940
Again, all that I
don't do explicitly

605
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,180
can be found in the notes.

606
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:55,200
So you would look at them later.

607
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,940
And so here is the second
case, a potential like this

608
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:06,460
and an energy like
that, energy level.

609
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:10,590
And what you get here is that
in fact, doing the counting

610
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,700
and analyzing the
boundary conditions,

611
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,010
you should do it by yourselves.

612
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,810
But you will see the
answers in the notes.

613
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:26,000
You get here continuous
spectrum, non-degenerate.

614
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,930
So you will get a
solution for every value

615
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:40,850
of the energy-- that's to mean,
continuous spectrum-- and one

616
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,820
solution each time.

617
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:52,770
Finally, this case-- if you
have an energy like this,

618
00:42:52,770 --> 00:43:11,350
e, you get continuous spectrum
and doubly degenerate,

619
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,320
so two solutions.

620
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:25,190
Now, after this,
there's one more result

621
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:30,480
that qualifies as a theorem.

622
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,030
And it's hard to
prove rigorously.

623
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:39,650
I will not attempt to prove
it here nor even in the notes.

624
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,700
It's hard enough.

625
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,110
So this theorem has
to do with nodes.

626
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:58,930
Theorem-- so if you have
the discrete bound state

627
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:11,560
spectrum of a one
dimensional potential,

628
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:22,620
and you list the energies
E1 less than E2 less than E3

629
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:26,080
like that, E1 is the
ground state energy.

630
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,380
Remember, this
spectrum is discrete.

631
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,740
So this is less than
E2, less than E3,

632
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,430
and it goes on like that,
the ground state energy.

633
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:45,680
Then, you have associated wave
functions, energy eigenstates

634
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,470
psi 1 of x, psi 2
of x, psi 3 of x.

635
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,890
Here is the theorem.

636
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:01,220
The theorem tells you something
about the vanishing of the wave

637
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:01,990
function.

638
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:09,530
It says that psi 1 has no nodes.

639
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:14,930
Psi 2 has one node.

640
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:19,570
Psi 3 has two nodes.

641
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:27,565
And so it goes so that psi
n has n minus one node.

642
00:45:27,565 --> 00:45:34,500
So psi n is greater
than-- well, it's correct.

643
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:41,070
Any n greater or equal
to 1 has n minus 1 nodes.

644
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:46,330
Now, there are several
ways people show this.

645
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:52,090
Mathematicians show it in
a rather delicate analysis.

646
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:55,210
Physicists have an
argument as well

647
00:45:55,210 --> 00:46:02,800
for this, which is based on
approximating any potential

648
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,950
by infinite square
wells to begin with.

649
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:09,960
So suppose you have a
potential like that.

650
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,700
Well, think of it as first being
a little potential like that,

651
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,700
an infinite square well.

652
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:21,310
And you start making the window
of the square well bigger.

653
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:25,060
The argument-- it's
a neat argument.

654
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:28,650
Maybe you can discuss
it in recitation.

655
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:30,470
I would suggest that.

656
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:31,690
It's a good argument.

657
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,730
But it's not rigorous.

658
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:37,040
But still, one can do
something like that.

659
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,140
You make it grow.

660
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,330
And what you know is that
the infinite square well,

661
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,620
the first wave
function has no node.

662
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:48,660
And as you change the screen to
make the potential really what

663
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:52,230
it's supposed to be and not
just that of a square well,

664
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:57,080
the wave function
cannot gain a node.

665
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,100
On the other hand, what you
will show in the homework

666
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,230
is something that is
a partial result which

667
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:10,890
says that the
solution with n plus 1

668
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:17,200
has at least one more node
than the solution with n.

669
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,350
So it's part of
what you can show.

670
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:22,130
And it doesn't take
too much effort.

671
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,540
And you can prove it rigorously.

672
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,740
So we will assign
that eventually

673
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,940
for a homework to do.

674
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:34,630
In the homework that you
have for the first homework,

675
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:39,360
you also have a problem
with delta functions.

676
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:43,660
And I suggest that you
read the notes that

677
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,110
will be posted today.

678
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:49,030
Because there's an example
there with delta functions.

679
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:51,490
If you study that
example, you'll

680
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:54,980
find the problem
quite easy to solve.

681
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,540
You may have solved already.

682
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:00,620
Some of you are very eager to
get going with the homework.

683
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:07,590
So it's something you
can study first, and then

684
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:10,920
make your life a little easier.

685
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:17,710
So what we're going to do now
for the rest of the lecture

686
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:20,330
is consider the
variational problem, which

687
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:24,100
is something you probably
haven't seen before,

688
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,475
the variational problem.

689
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:43,410
This problem has to do with
calculus of variations.

690
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,680
Now, calculus of
variations is something

691
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,200
considered fairly advanced.

692
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,535
And therefore, as
you will see, we

693
00:48:52,535 --> 00:48:57,390
will avoid some of the major
difficulties of calculus

694
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:01,930
of variations in our discussion
of the variational principle.

695
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:11,860
But I wanted to mention a
little story about this problem.

696
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:18,590
So this calculus of variations
is a more complicated version

697
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:26,140
of maxima and minima in which in
maxima and minima of functions

698
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,800
you look at the function.

699
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,580
And if you could plot it, you
could say, here's a maximum,

700
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,360
here's a minimum.

701
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,427
If you want to figure out
where they are, you know.

702
00:49:35,427 --> 00:49:38,050
You take a derivative,
set it equal to 0,

703
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:41,300
you find the maxima and minima.

704
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,030
So the typical
calculus problem is

705
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:45,635
one in which you
have a function,

706
00:49:45,635 --> 00:49:47,930
and you want the
maxima and minima.

707
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:51,920
The variational
problem is a problem

708
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,190
in which you want to maximize
or minimize something.

709
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:00,890
But what you don't know is not
where the maximum or minimum

710
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:04,440
occurs, but which
kind of function

711
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,090
will give you this
maximum or minimum.

712
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:09,890
So your unknown is
not a point where

713
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:13,790
there's a maximum or a
minimum but a function where

714
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:16,310
there is a maximum
and a minimum.

715
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:20,660
So it's slightly
more complicated.

716
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,940
So this is the
calculus of variations.

717
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:28,290
And people wonder
when did it start.

718
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:31,530
It actually seems to have
first been discussed by Newton.

719
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:36,080
And it's quite an
interesting story.

720
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,060
Newton was trying to
understand apparently

721
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,470
the following problem.

722
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:49,610
If you would have a cross
sectional area like this,

723
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:53,700
he asked the question,
how should you

724
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:59,640
make a solid out of this
by tapering it and ending

725
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,810
with this, tapering
it, in such a way

726
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:06,070
that as it moves
in a viscous fluid,

727
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:10,980
the resistance is the minimum
possible-- very complicated

728
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,950
problem.

729
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:16,180
And as you can imagine, this
is a complicated problem

730
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:19,590
because you're trying to find
a shape-- not just a maximum

731
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:22,060
or a minimum of a
function but what

732
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:25,930
shape maximizes
or minimizes this.

733
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:28,600
So apparently, he
solved the problem

734
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:33,950
and wrote it in Principia but
didn't explain his solution.

735
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,650
And people for years were
trying to figure it out.

736
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:41,130
And nobody could figure
out how he did it.

737
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:47,710
Then, the story goes that this
mathematician Johann Bernoulli

738
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:53,870
in 1696 came up with a
challenge to all mathematicians.

739
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:56,380
At that time, people
would announce a problem

740
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:59,110
and challenge to
see who's smart,

741
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,580
who can solve this problem.

742
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:13,380
So Johann Bernoulli
in around 1696

743
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:18,410
poses a problem of, you're
given two points in the plane,

744
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:23,440
in the vertical plane like
this blackboard, point this, A,

745
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,560
and point B in here.

746
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,260
You must design the
curve of shortest time

747
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,430
for fall, so some curve here.

748
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:37,465
If you put an object
and let it fall,

749
00:52:37,465 --> 00:52:42,270
it will get the fastest
to that point, so maybe

750
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:44,950
something that looks like this.

751
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:49,860
It's a complicated curve, or
at least not all that simple.

752
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:56,330
And he asked all the
people to solve it,

753
00:52:56,330 --> 00:53:00,740
gave them one year to solve it.

754
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,920
So who was around at that time?

755
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,060
Well, one person that got
the letter was Leibniz.

756
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:12,800
He got it on the 9th of
June of that year, 1696.

757
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,340
And he answered it,
sent an email back,

758
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:20,000
by the 16th of
June with a letter

759
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,285
with a complete solution.

760
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:29,640
It's a funny thing that actually
apparently Newton was very busy

761
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,540
and didn't receive this letter.

762
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,510
Or something happened,
and he got it one day,

763
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:39,750
and he actually solved
the problem in one night.

764
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:43,170
It took him one full
night to solve it.

765
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:45,090
Now, you say, well,
how brilliant.

766
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:49,670
And true, but given that
he had solved this problem,

767
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:54,590
he was criticized as being
really slow and-- how come

768
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:56,680
you took 12 hours to
solve this problem?

769
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,210
So it's quite amazing.

770
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:03,980
There's a lot of Bernoullis.

771
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:08,970
And apparently, this
question by Jacob Bernoulli,

772
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:11,990
the main purpose
of this question

773
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:16,820
was to demonstrate to everybody
that his older brother,

774
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,640
Jacob Bernoulli, who had
invented the Bernoulli numbers,

775
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,790
was actually an
incompetent person that

776
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:25,990
could not solve this problem.

777
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:29,110
So that was apparently
what he wanted to do.

778
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:31,650
It's a rather famous family.

779
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:34,000
But they obviously
didn't get along.

780
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,330
But apparently, Jacob did
manage to solve the problem.

781
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:41,515
So Jacob Bernoulli, Leibniz, and
Newton all solved the problem.

782
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:47,670
Johann Bernoulli, the one that
started this problem-- and I

783
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:50,220
think it's maybe
with a double N,

784
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,510
I'm sorry-- his son
is Daniel Bernoulli.

785
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:56,470
And engineers know
him, because that's

786
00:54:56,470 --> 00:55:01,160
the Bernoulli of the Bernoulli
fluid dynamics stuff.

787
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,775
So the problem is
not all that easy.

788
00:55:05,775 --> 00:55:09,490
And calculus of variations
determines this shape.

789
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:14,580
So the calculus of variation
applied to quantum mechanics

790
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:21,000
asks, here, this function is
determined by the principle

791
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,250
that it minimizes time.

792
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:26,730
So you have the
Schrodinger Equation.

793
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:31,130
And you could ask, you have
all these Eigenfunctions.

794
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:33,870
What do they minimize?

795
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:36,610
Is there something
they're minimize?

796
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:38,230
And the answer is yes.

797
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,510
And this is what
you'll understand

798
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:43,330
in the next few minutes.

799
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:46,060
So what is the problem
we want to solve?

800
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:52,280
We want to solve the
problem h psi equal e psi.

801
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,670
So some Hamiltonian.

802
00:55:54,670 --> 00:56:00,390
Now my notation
will be such that it

803
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,740
applies to three
dimensions as well.

804
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,990
So I'll put just
arrows on top of it,

805
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:07,850
and you would have to write
the proper Hamiltonian.

806
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:11,690
It will not be necessary for
you to know the Hamiltonian.

807
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:15,890
So I'll put psi
of x here, meaning

808
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:21,360
that this is equally valid
for more than one dimension.

809
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:28,200
Now we want to find
solutions of this equation.

810
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,870
And you can say, what do
they maximize or minimize?

811
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:33,600
Well we won't get to
it until 15 minutes.

812
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:37,110
First let's try
something simpler.

813
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:39,740
How about, can we
learn something

814
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:43,950
about the ground state
energy of the system?

815
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:48,360
So let's try to think about
the ground state energy.

816
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,240
State energy.

817
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:05,440
Now consider ground
state energy and we'll

818
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:14,390
consider an
arbitrary-- arbitrary

819
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:17,960
is the most
important word here--

820
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,103
psi of x that is normalized.

821
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:23,722
Is normalized.

822
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:34,020
So integral the x of psi
squared is equal to 1.

823
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,800
And here comes the claim.

824
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:49,030
The first claim
that we can make.

825
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:51,470
You see, this wave
function doesn't

826
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:53,450
solve the Schrodinger equation.

827
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:56,390
That's what we
mean by arbitrary.

828
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:02,950
It's just any function of
space that is normalizable.

829
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,980
Doesn't solve the
Schrodinger equation.

830
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,110
Never the less,
you are commanded

831
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:09,070
to compute the
following quantity.

832
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,090
This quantity is
also by definition

833
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:24,480
what we call the
expectation value

834
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,090
of the Hamiltonian
in the state psi.

835
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:33,850
I love the fact, the
remarkable fact that we're

836
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:38,000
going to show now, is
that this thing provides

837
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:46,615
an upper bound for the ground
state energy for all psi.

838
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:54,550
So let me try to make
sure we understand

839
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:58,160
what's happening here.

840
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,990
Here it says you don't know
the ground state energy

841
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:03,880
but you're going to
learn something about it.

842
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,880
Something that's
interesting is if you

843
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,000
know that it has an upper bound,
so the ground state energy

844
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,190
is definitely not
higher than this one,

845
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:14,230
so you learn something.

846
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:17,080
Would be ideal if you
had also lower bound

847
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,500
so you knew it's in this range.

848
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:24,040
But an upper bound is
a nice thing to have.

849
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:28,250
And the claim here is that
each time you try an arbitrary

850
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:32,090
function, you put anything
here, you ever write,

851
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:34,840
you've got an upper bound.

852
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,020
So how is this used?

853
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:42,450
You try arbitrary functions
that you think look possibly

854
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:45,560
like the wave function
of a bound state.

855
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,730
And you get numbers
and you already

856
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:49,880
know that the ground
state energy smaller

857
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,470
than some number.

858
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:57,240
So it's a rather nice way
of getting some information

859
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,350
about the ground state energy.

860
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:04,120
So this psi effects is
called a trial wave function.

861
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:10,320
Is a trial wave function.

862
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:22,040
So is the statement
of this theorem clear?

863
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,250
Not the proof,
but the statement.

864
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:25,260
Do we have questions?

865
01:00:30,955 --> 01:00:31,455
Yes.

866
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:36,368
AUDIENCE: Is there any
statement about how

867
01:00:36,368 --> 01:00:38,808
using the wave
function will give us

868
01:00:38,808 --> 01:00:43,200
how accurate an
estimate [INAUDIBLE]

869
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,870
PROFESSOR: No.

870
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:47,655
We're going to become
good and figure out

871
01:00:47,655 --> 01:00:52,280
some nice way of choosing
wave functions, but no.

872
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,380
Once you tried you
got some information.

873
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:58,420
And you may not know
so easily whether you

874
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,806
could go much lower.

875
01:01:00,806 --> 01:01:05,210
You can try a little, but
there's no clear way to know.

876
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:10,170
This is just some
partial information.

877
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:10,670
OK.

878
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:14,270
So let me first prove this.

879
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:21,180
We'll prove it and then explain
a little more what it all

880
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:23,430
means.

881
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,350
So the proof.

882
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:32,480
Now it's a proof
under quotation marks.

883
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,360
I will make a few assumptions.

884
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:41,030
Basically, that I don't
have a continuous spectrum.

885
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:45,740
Now that assumption is done for
me to write a simpler proof,

886
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,780
not because the
result doesn't hold.

887
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:51,830
So the proof is
good, but I will just

888
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:55,750
consider for notational
purposes no continuous spectrum.

889
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:58,190
So we'll have a
ground state energy

890
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:03,610
which is e1 that is maybe less
than or equal to e2 less than

891
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:07,550
or equal e3 like that.

892
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:13,730
So you even may consider
the [? genorisies. ?]

893
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:19,220
And we have h psi n
is equal to en psi n.

894
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:26,890
So what do we have?

895
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:29,130
We have a trial wave function.

896
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:33,810
So your trial wave
function since it's

897
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:36,780
an arbitrary
function of x should

898
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:42,775
be expandable by completeness
as a serious or a superb

899
01:02:42,775 --> 01:02:46,670
position of the
energy eigenstates.

900
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,210
Let me clarify this point.

901
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:54,550
This is a trial wave function.

902
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:57,910
Doesn't solve the
Schrodinger equation.

903
01:02:57,910 --> 01:03:04,180
So this Doesn't solve this
energy eigenstate equation.

904
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:06,970
So in fact, it doesn't
solve it because this

905
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:09,690
is a superb position
of many in here.

906
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:13,110
So that's consistent
with this, and the fact

907
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:17,970
that this wave function
as given in here

908
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:22,200
just can be represented
using the energy eigenstates.

909
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,050
But being a superb
position, it's

910
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:28,490
not an energy eigenstate which
is true because a trial wave

911
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:31,100
function is something that
you invent out of your head.

912
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,670
It's not a solution.

913
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:36,090
If you had a solution,
you wouldn't need this.

914
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:37,550
So you don't have a solution.

915
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:40,080
You invent the trial wave
function, and you have this.

916
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:46,160
A couple of things.

917
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:51,395
The psi squared
integral being one.

918
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:58,960
You can do that
integral, that condition,

919
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:05,410
is the sum of their
bn-2nd is equal to 1.

920
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,880
This I use the orthonormality.

921
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,190
You can elevate this.

922
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:18,430
It's sort of the kinds of
things we're doing last time.

923
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:21,910
Please make sure you
know how to do that.

924
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:23,960
Then there's the
other computation

925
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,020
that we also have
sketched last time, which

926
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:32,535
is that the integral
of psi star h

927
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:37,570
psi which is what
we want to compute,

928
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:45,760
h hat psi is actually bn-2nd en.

929
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:53,920
So that was
something we're doing

930
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,650
towards the end of last lecture.

931
01:04:56,650 --> 01:05:00,920
And this computation takes a
few lines, but it was there.

932
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,330
It's in the notes.

933
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:09,860
And now comes the kind
of thing we want to say.

934
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:11,170
Look at this sum.

935
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:17,360
It has b1, e1, b2, e2,
b3, e3, but e2, e3, e4,

936
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:23,130
all those are bigger,
or at most, equal to e1.

937
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:27,440
So if I did, here,
the following bad joke

938
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:35,140
of substituting en for e1, which
is not the same, if I put here

939
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:39,450
bn squared n equals
1 to infinity.

940
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:44,500
I put here e1,
well this is bigger

941
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,480
than that because e2 is
possibly bigger than e1,

942
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,450
e3 is bigger than e1.

943
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:52,610
But it may be equal.

944
01:05:52,610 --> 01:05:55,940
But at this moment, e1
can go out of the sum.

945
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:59,860
So this is e1 times
this sum which

946
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:06,180
is 1 because bn is equal to 1.

947
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:10,790
And e1 is the ground state
energy by definition.

948
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:13,040
So the ground state
energy is less

949
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,970
than this which
is the expectation

950
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:17,760
value of the Hamiltonian.

951
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,670
Pretty simple, in
fact, the proof

952
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:22,700
is really a little too simple.

953
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:30,790
Where do we go from now?

954
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:36,540
Well let's make a
more general statement

955
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:38,590
of the variational principal.

956
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:42,230
Again, sometimes
it's not all that

957
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:45,380
convenient to have
normalized wave functions.

958
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:58,890
So recall that if psi
of x is not normalized,

959
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:06,810
psi of x over the square root
of integral of psi-2nd dx is.

960
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:18,510
Therefore if you
hand me an arbitrary

961
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,950
psi of x that is
really arbitrary.

962
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:24,250
You don't even bother
to normalize it.

963
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:28,200
Then when I plug
here in this formula

964
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,190
it is supposed to be normalized.

965
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:33,530
So I plug the second
expression there.

966
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:40,670
So therefore I get
that egs less than

967
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:46,320
or equal to the
integral of psi star h

968
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:54,650
psi the x over integral
of psi star psi the x.

969
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:08,860
This is actually
nicer in one way

970
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:12,770
because you don't have to work
with normalized wave functions.

971
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:15,550
And that result
must be true still.

972
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:16,430
Yes?

973
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:17,305
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

974
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:21,729
PROFESSOR: Sure.

975
01:08:21,729 --> 01:08:23,779
It cannot be
completely arbitrary,

976
01:08:23,779 --> 01:08:27,569
the function should
we normalizable.

977
01:08:27,569 --> 01:08:29,654
Doesn't have to be
normalized but normalizable.

978
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:34,160
So here you got.

979
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,890
And here let me introduce
just a little name.

980
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:41,564
f of psi.

981
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:49,586
f of psi is what is
called a functional.

982
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:54,084
f of is a functional.

983
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,240
What is a functional?

984
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:03,899
A functional is a
machine or an expression

985
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:10,750
whose input is a function
and whose output is a number.

986
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:16,390
So here f of psi
is a functional.

987
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:19,390
And maybe I should use brackets.

988
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:23,529
Many times people with brackets
denote that, watch out,

989
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:26,710
this is not a function,
it's a functional.

990
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:29,680
And here it is.

991
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:33,670
No dash there.

992
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:38,250
You give me a psi of
x, which is a function,

993
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:40,760
and then this is a
number because you've

994
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,640
done the integrals.

995
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:47,600
So that is like the
Brachistochrone problem, that

996
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,590
a funny name for it.

997
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:51,359
Here it is.

998
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,790
There is a function
now which is the time

999
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,660
that it takes to go here.

1000
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:00,030
You give me a path,
a function, and I

1001
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:03,570
can calculate the time it will
take the mass to get here.

1002
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:08,460
So this was the issue of
finding a critical point

1003
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:09,840
of a functional.

1004
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:14,740
So actually we start to see,
it seems that the ground state

1005
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:17,835
energy is the minimum
of this functional.

1006
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:25,080
And what this
interesting as well

1007
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:31,150
is that when you get the
minimum you will have gotten

1008
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:33,270
a ground state wave function.

1009
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:36,580
So the ground state
wave function actually

1010
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:40,830
is the thing that
minimizes this functional

1011
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:45,250
and gives you some value,
the ground state energy.

1012
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:50,080
A little more in a
couple of minutes.

1013
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,990
Let's do an example.

1014
01:10:52,990 --> 01:11:08,350
How do we use this so now if
you think about this carefully

1015
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:14,220
it's kind of dizzying because
what is sell functional,

1016
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:15,670
really?

1017
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:19,720
It's, in some sense, a function
in an infinite dimensional

1018
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:24,770
space because a function
itself is specified

1019
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:27,670
by infinitely many numbers
that you can change.

1020
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:33,750
So how many dimensions
you have is how many ways

1021
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:38,660
you can move your hands, but
they are linearly independent.

1022
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:41,250
But if you have a function,
and you can change it,

1023
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,490
you can change it here,
you can change it there,

1024
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:45,760
or you can change it
there, and those are all

1025
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,170
orthogonal directions.

1026
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,180
You're finding a critical point.

1027
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,190
When you find the
critical point,

1028
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:56,070
you should imagine that you're
plotting a function that is not

1029
01:11:56,070 --> 01:12:00,040
one dimensional function or
two dimensional function,

1030
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,740
but it's infinitely
dimensional function.

1031
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:09,060
Direction one, direction two,
infinitely many directions.

1032
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:12,010
And suddenly in this
infinitely many directions

1033
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:14,770
you find the critical point.

1034
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:19,720
It's really incredible that
one can do these things.

1035
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,620
So you're at that
critical point,

1036
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:25,250
and you can deform
the energy eigenstate

1037
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:28,230
by making it a little
fatter here or thinner

1038
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:29,460
here or up there.

1039
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,120
And those are the
infinite directions

1040
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,550
in any direction that
you will the energy

1041
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:37,837
goes up because you're
at the global minimum

1042
01:12:37,837 --> 01:12:38,670
it's pretty amazing.

1043
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:45,850
Something that you will
prove in the homework

1044
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:50,550
is that actually it's even more.

1045
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:58,560
Every single eigenstate
is a critical point

1046
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:59,580
of this functional.

1047
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:02,050
So you've got the
lowest energy state

1048
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:05,850
and in that infinite dimensional
space in every direction

1049
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:08,700
that you move you go up.

1050
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:12,960
The first excited state
is another critical point.

1051
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,750
But it will not be
an absolute minimum.

1052
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:20,530
It will be a [? saddle ?]
an infinite dimensional

1053
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:22,560
[? saddle ?] which
are infinitely

1054
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,010
many directions in
which you go up.

1055
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:27,560
There's one direction
in which you go down

1056
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:31,600
because you could flow
towards the ground state.

1057
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,820
So the first excited state
is the [? saddle ?] but these

1058
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:38,640
are all stationary points
of this functional.

1059
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:44,356
So we'll conclude by
doing this example.

1060
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:52,971
Sorry, what is the question?

1061
01:13:52,971 --> 01:13:53,846
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1062
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:59,380
PROFESSOR: I didn't assume
it's non-degenerate.

1063
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:02,960
So if you have two things that
have the same ground state,

1064
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,630
the functional will have, in
fact, the degeneracy there

1065
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:13,040
will be two solutions
that have the same energy.

1066
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:17,640
And any linear combination of
them will have the same energy.

1067
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:21,080
The proof that I did here
doesn't assume non-degeneracy,

1068
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:25,080
it's even true with
degenerate things.

1069
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:30,910
So the example is an
example for illustration,

1070
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:35,880
not for solving something
that you can't do otherwise.

1071
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,240
So it's a delta
function potential.

1072
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:44,580
v of x is minus alpha delta
of x with alpha positive.

1073
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:47,740
And the ground state
energy is well known.

1074
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:52,450
It's minus m alpha
squared over 2h-2nd.

1075
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:57,520
You've solved this
problem many times in 804.

1076
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,390
So trial wave function.

1077
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:01,130
Well you know how
it should look,

1078
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:03,550
but let's assume you don't.

1079
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:07,010
And you say, it's some
sort of [INAUDIBLE].

1080
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:09,610
So trial.

1081
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:15,630
It would be psi of x equals
e to the minus x squared.

1082
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:20,930
While this would do,
you're going to work hard

1083
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:23,330
and you're not going to
reap all the benefits

1084
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:25,310
of this calculation.

1085
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:29,320
So what you should do at this
moment is put a constant here.

1086
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:35,190
Minus beta squared x squared
and I'll put the minus one half.

1087
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:36,815
This is our trial wave function.

1088
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:45,330
You see, by this, you're
going to get an expression.

1089
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:47,460
You calculate this
number, and you're

1090
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,410
going to get the
function of beta.

1091
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:50,800
Beta is not going to disappear.

1092
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:56,040
And therefore, you're going
to know that the ground state

1093
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:59,360
energy is less than
this function of beta.

1094
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:04,120
And then you can adjust
beta to get the best bound.

1095
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:07,020
So beta is put as a
parameter to begin with,

1096
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,260
and we hope to use it.

1097
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:19,400
So note that integral of
psi squared dx in this case

1098
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:23,960
is equal to square
root of pi over beta.

1099
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:29,320
So we have to calculate
this whole functional.

1100
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:33,656
So this integral
of psi star-- well

1101
01:16:33,656 --> 01:16:36,420
I don't have to bother with
psi star because it's real.

1102
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:42,920
h psi over psi psi,
and what do we get?

1103
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:45,070
Well the denominator is easy.

1104
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:48,840
So we beta over
square root of pi,

1105
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:51,005
and let me write the
whole thing here.

1106
01:16:51,005 --> 01:16:54,970
dx the psi would have
e to the minus one half

1107
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:58,750
beta squared x squared
minus h squared

1108
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:07,100
over 2m d-2nd dx2nd
minus alpha delta of x.

1109
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,910
And another wave function,
e to the minus one

1110
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:13,980
half beta squared x-2nd.

1111
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:14,650
OK.

1112
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:16,390
So you have to evaluate that.

1113
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:20,096
And that's the part
that is not so much fun.

1114
01:17:20,096 --> 01:17:23,760
For any integral
that you have in 805,

1115
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:29,340
we believe that you can use
Mathematica or Maple or MATLAB

1116
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,220
or whatever and do it.

1117
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:34,550
The only reason not to
use any of these things

1118
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:37,240
is if you think you could
not do the integral.

1119
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:39,490
But once you realize,
oh, this is an integral,

1120
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:42,720
I know how to do,
don't waste time.

1121
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,340
Use any of those programs.

1122
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:48,400
Now, this part of the
integral is kind of easy

1123
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,610
because the delta function
just picks the value of 0.

1124
01:17:51,610 --> 01:17:56,020
So this part of the
integral gives you

1125
01:17:56,020 --> 01:18:00,780
minus beta alpha over
square root of pi.

1126
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:03,530
The other part of the
integral, however,

1127
01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:06,120
is a little more complicated.

1128
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:10,240
Believe it or not, it
makes a big difference

1129
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,110
whether you take
the two derivatives

1130
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:14,710
of this function or
you integrate by parts.

1131
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:18,500
If you integrate by parts,
you save a lot of work.

1132
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,910
So let me integrate by parts.

1133
01:18:20,910 --> 01:18:26,120
This becomes, plus beta
over square root of h,

1134
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:32,320
h-2nd over 2m,
integral dx of ddx of e

1135
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:38,590
to the minus one half beta
squared x-2nd squared.

1136
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:41,850
So you integrate by
parts one of the ddx

1137
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:46,020
and then you have the other
ddx, so it's the thing squared.

1138
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:51,250
And that's an easier
integral to do.

1139
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:53,850
We don't want to
bother with this,

1140
01:18:53,850 --> 01:18:58,280
but this whole
thing then becomes

1141
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:04,750
minus beta over square root of
pi, alpha plus beta squared h

1142
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:06,450
squared over 4m.

1143
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:11,740
That's the whole
answer And that's

1144
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:16,330
the valuation of
this whole thing.

1145
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:18,490
So look what you get.

1146
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:21,770
You got a function
of beta indeed.

1147
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:24,800
So how does that
function of beta look?

1148
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,850
It's 0 for beta equals 0 is 0
for some other possible beta,

1149
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:31,860
it's going to look like this.

1150
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:34,320
So there's a point at
which this function is

1151
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:37,800
going to have a minimum, and
we should choose that point

1152
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:41,545
to get the best upper
bound on the function.

1153
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:53,040
Our claim is that following
from the variational theorem

1154
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,690
that we've proven
is that the e ground

1155
01:19:55,690 --> 01:20:03,220
state is less than or equal
than the minimum value over beta

1156
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:09,050
of this beta squared
h squared over 4m

1157
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:12,875
minus beta square
root of pie alpha.

1158
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:17,150
So you minimize over beta,
and yet still the ground state

1159
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:21,440
energy must be a little
smaller than that.

1160
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:22,860
Well what do you get?

1161
01:20:25,790 --> 01:20:29,910
You do this, this minimization
gives beta equal 2m

1162
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:34,660
alpha over h squared
square root of pi.

1163
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:37,190
It's a little messy
but not terrible.

1164
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:41,230
And you substitute, and you
get that e ground state is

1165
01:20:41,230 --> 01:20:49,140
less than or equal than m alpha
squared over pi h squared.

1166
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:56,400
And to better write it as 2
over pi times minus m alpha

1167
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:02,300
squared over 2h-2nd which is
the true ground state energy.

1168
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:06,660
So let's just make sure we
understand what has happened.

1169
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:08,640
Here is the energy.

1170
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,880
Here is zero.

1171
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:15,360
Energy as just a vertical
plot here is zero.

1172
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:20,350
The true ground state
energy of this problem

1173
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:25,280
is this one, let's call
it egs, is negative.

1174
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,970
And we go 2 over pi times that.

1175
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:33,200
2 over pi is about 0.64.

1176
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:40,560
So the bound says
that here is 0.64 egs.

1177
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,650
So that's what the
bound told you.

1178
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:49,180
The bound state energy must
be lower than this quantity.

1179
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:50,490
We got close.

1180
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:53,590
Not impressively
close, but the work

1181
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:55,850
functional was not
all that bad either.

1182
01:21:58,800 --> 01:21:59,966
Question?

1183
01:21:59,966 --> 01:22:01,830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
always going

1184
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:04,160
to be a constant times
incorrect energy value

1185
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,750
or is it just the
closest approximation?

1186
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,360
PROFESSOR: Is it
going to be what?

1187
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,176
AUDIENCE: Is it
always going to be

1188
01:22:10,176 --> 01:22:12,936
a constant times the correct
energy value or is it just--

1189
01:22:12,936 --> 01:22:14,890
PROFESSOR: Well it
typically is like that

1190
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:19,000
because of dimensional units.

1191
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,900
You're looking for a
constant because you're not

1192
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:23,150
looking for the function.

1193
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:28,590
So you will get a number times
a correct value, yes, indeed.

1194
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:33,646
That's an illustration of the
problem of wave functions.

1195
01:22:33,646 --> 01:22:36,310
You know the variational
principle tells you

1196
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:38,310
things about the
ground state but allows

1197
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:41,620
you to find the first
excited state as well

1198
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:45,570
if the potential is symmetric,
will allow you to prove

1199
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:49,060
that any attractive
potential has a bound state.

1200
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:51,750
And you will prove
in the homework

1201
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:56,040
