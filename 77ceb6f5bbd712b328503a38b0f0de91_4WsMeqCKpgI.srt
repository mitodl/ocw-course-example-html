BARTON ZWIEBACH: [INAUDIBLE]
of today's lecture

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:28,220
is coherent states of
the harmonic oscillator.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,860
So let me begin by telling
you about some things

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:40,730
we've learned in the last
lecture, and here they are.

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:46,080
We learned how to calculate the
so-called Heisenberg operators.

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,480
Remember, if you have
a Schrodinger operator,

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,710
you subject it to
this transformation

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,070
with a unitary operator.

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,880
That creates time evolution
and that gives you

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,980
the Heisenberg operator.

18
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,319
We learned things about
Heisenberg expectation values.

19
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,710
If the Hamiltonian is
time independent, h, time

20
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,550
independent, the
formula is quite simple

21
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,180
and gives you the Heisenberg
operator at the later time.

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,650
So we did this.

23
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,970
We found, in fact,
Heisenberg operators

24
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,760
satisfy equations of motion.

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,960
And we calculated the
Heisenberg operators

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,260
for the harmonic oscillator.

27
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,430
That was our main
achievement last time,

28
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,410
a formula for the time
development of the x

29
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,830
and p operators in the
Heisenberg picture.

30
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:50,680
And that really contains all
the information of the dynamics,

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,000
as you will see today, when
we will be using this stuff.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,242
Now, I suggested that you
read-- and you may do it later.

33
00:02:02,242 --> 00:02:03,700
There's no need
that you've done it

34
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,560
for today-- the
information on the time

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,980
development of the creation
and annihilation operators.

36
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:18,340
You see, the a and a dagger are
different inverses of x and p,

37
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,880
are linear combinations.

38
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,450
So the a and the
a dagger operators

39
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,776
also can be further
Schrodinger operators

40
00:02:26,776 --> 00:02:29,530
that have no time dependence.

41
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,150
And suddenly, if you go
to the Heisenberg picture,

42
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,290
the creation and
annihilation operators

43
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,240
become time dependent operators.

44
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,700
So that's in the notes.

45
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,070
You can read about it.

46
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:49,070
So we define the time
dependent operator, a hat,

47
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,470
to be the Heisenberg
version of a hat.

48
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,100
And you're supposed
to do a calculation

49
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:03,770
and try it or read it, and
the answer is very nice,

50
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,030
simply a phase dependence.

51
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,450
The a is a at time equals
0, the Schrodinger 1 times

52
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,550
e to the minus i omega t.

53
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:21,470
Then a dagger is just
what you would expect,

54
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:27,330
the dagger of this, which the
face has an opposite sign and a

55
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,660
becomes a dagger.

56
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:35,160
Finally, if you
substitute this a and a

57
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,920
daggers in this formula.

58
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,640
For example, you
could say x Heisenberg

59
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,450
is a Heisenberg plus
a dagger Heisenberg.

60
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,640
And you substitute those
Heisenberg values there,

61
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,780
you will obtain this.

62
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,200
Same for the momentum.

63
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,280
If you put Heisenberg,
Heisenberg, Heisenberg,

64
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,880
remember, if you have an
equality of Schrodinger

65
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,230
operators, it also
holds when you

66
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,270
put Heisenberg in
every operator.

67
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,180
And therefore, if you
put the Heisenberg a, a,

68
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,940
and use those values, you
will recover this equation.

69
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:17,640
So in a sense, these equations
are equivalent to these ones.

70
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,370
And that's basically
our situation.

71
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,550
This is what we've
learned so far,

72
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:35,480
and our goal today is to
apply this to understand

73
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,660
coherent states of the
harmonic oscillator.

74
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,570
Now, why do we
want to understand

75
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,400
coherent states of the
harmonic oscillator?

76
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,550
You want to understand coherent
states because the energy

77
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,150
eigenstates are
extraordinarily quantum.

78
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,720
The energy eigenstates of
the harmonic oscillator

79
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,600
don't look at all-- and
you've seen the expectation

80
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,120
value of the position.

81
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,350
It's time independent.

82
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,710
It just doesn't change.

83
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:11,030
Expectation value of any
operator in a stationary state

84
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,400
is a constant.

85
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,730
It just doesn't change.

86
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:19,295
So you have any eigenstate,
any energy eigenstate

87
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:21,680
of the harmonic
oscillator, you ask,

88
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,660
what is the position
of this particle doing?

89
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,230
Nothing.

90
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,680
What is the momentum
of this particle doing?

91
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,520
Nothing.

92
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,230
So nevertheless, of course,
it's an interesting state,

93
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:38,770
but we want to construct
quantum mechanical states that

94
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,630
behave a little like the
classical states we're

95
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,830
accustomed to.

96
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,100
And that's what
coherent states do.

97
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,260
We'll have an application
of coherent states

98
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,710
to light, photons,
coherent photons.

99
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,580
What are they?

100
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,880
We'll see it later this week.

101
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,200
So that's the reason we want
to understand coherent states,

102
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,640
because we want some
states that in some ways

103
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,980
behave classically, or
close to classically.

104
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,640
So they have many
applications, these states,

105
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,350
and you will see some
of them in this lecture.

106
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,430
I'm going to try to keep this
blackboard there, untouched,

107
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,336
so that we can refer
to these equations.

108
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:47,540
So our first step is considering
translation operators.

109
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,740
So let's consider the
unitary translation operator.

110
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:59,600
So translation operators.

111
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,580
So this translation operator
that I will write as T sub x0

112
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,590
will be defined to be
the exponential of e

113
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:18,090
to the minus i p
hat x0 over h bar.

114
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,565
You have seen such
operators before.

115
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,380
We've seen a lot of
them in the homework.

116
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,770
So first of all,
why is it unitary?

117
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,655
well, it's unitary because x0
is supposed to be a real number.

118
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,650
p is Hermitian.

119
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,565
Therefore, this with
the i is anti-Hermitian,

120
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:55,580
and an exponential of
anti-Hermitian operator

121
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,940
is unitary.

122
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,710
Now, it has, actually,
a very simple property.

123
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:09,585
The multiplication of two
of those operators is what?

124
00:08:09,585 --> 00:08:14,130
Well, you have an exponential,
e to the minus ipx0,

125
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,790
and an exponential followed,
e to the minus ipy0.

126
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,120
Now, if you're well
trained in 805,

127
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,850
you should get a little
nervous for a second

128
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,610
because you don't know,
can I treat it easily?

129
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,690
And then you relax and say,
yes, these two operators,

130
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,929
whatsoever the numbers here,
this with another one with a y0

131
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,360
would commute.

132
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,260
Therefore, they can be put
together in the exponential,

133
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,440
and this is T of x0 plus y0.

134
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,000
No combo Baker-Hausdorff
needed here.

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,140
It's just straightforward.

136
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:11,440
So what is Tx0 dagger?

137
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,610
T x0 dagger, if you
take the dagger,

138
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,580
you change this i for
a minus i, so it's

139
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,920
exactly the same as
changing the sign of x0.

140
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,630
So this is T of minus x0.

141
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:35,430
And by this identity, T
of minus x0 with a T of x0

142
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,830
would be T of 0, which
is the unit operator.

143
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:47,800
So T of minus x0 is
the inverse of T of x0,

144
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,082
confirming that the
operator is unitary.

145
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:55,600
The inverse is the dagger.

146
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,040
So I used here that
this is the inverse

147
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,860
because T minus x0 times T
x0 is T of 0 is equal to 1.

148
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,980
So I could mention here, T of 0
is equal to the unit operator.

149
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,170
So these are our
translation operators,

150
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,570
but you don't get
the intuition of what

151
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,210
they do unless you
compute a little more.

152
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,700
And a little more than you
should compute is this.

153
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:36,960
What is T x0 dagger x T x0?

154
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,610
And what is T x0 dagger p T x0?

155
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,300
Now, why do we ask for
these particular things?

156
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,410
Why don't I ask, what is
x hat multiplied by T x0?

157
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,180
Why do I ask this?

158
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,660
It is because an operator
acting on an operator

159
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,820
always does this.

160
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,490
If you say an operator is
acting on another operator,

161
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,580
the first operator
that is acting,

162
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,720
you put it here
with its inverse.

163
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,420
It happens to be unitary,
so you put the dagger,

164
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,750
and you put the operator here.

165
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,580
And this is the
right thing to do.

166
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,200
It has a simple answer and
a simple interpretation,

167
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,190
as we'll see now.

168
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,910
So what is T, this
commutator, supposed to be?

169
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,220
Well, you can probably
imagine what this is.

170
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,220
You've calculated
it in homework,

171
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,960
so I will not do it again.

172
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,470
This is x plus x0.

173
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:54,080
So you get the operator, x,
plus x0 times the unit operator.

174
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,490
That was done before.

175
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:03,730
And here, you get just p.

176
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,360
Why?

177
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,690
Because p hat is
the only operator

178
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,880
that exists in this translation
thing, so p commutes with p.

179
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,110
So these two operators commute
and the T tagger hits the T,

180
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,960
and it's equal to 1, so
that's a simple thing.

181
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:30,400
So why is this reasonable?

182
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,160
It's because of the
following situation.

183
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,840
If you have a state, psi,
you can ask, for example,

184
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:46,120
what is the expectation
value of x in the state psi?

185
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,970
And if this state
represents a particle that

186
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:01,610
is sitting somewhere here,
roughly, the expectation value

187
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,860
of x is basically
that vector that

188
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,190
tells you where the particle is.

189
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:16,260
So you could ask, then,
what is the expectation

190
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:21,560
value of x in the
state T x0 psi?

191
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,690
So you want to know,
what does T x0 really do?

192
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,330
Here, it seems to say
something, takes the operator

193
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,440
and displaces it, but
that seems abstract.

194
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,530
If you ask this question,
this seems more physical.

195
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,470
You had a state, you act with
an operator, it's another state.

196
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,350
How does it look?

197
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:58,140
Well, this expectation value
would be the expectation value

198
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:07,470
of x on T x0 psi,
and the [? brau ?]

199
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,240
would be psi T x0 dagger.

200
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,280
So actually, that
expectation value

201
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,220
builds precisely
this combination,

202
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,660
and that's why it's meaningful.

203
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:38,790
And since you know what this
is, this is psi x plus x0 psi.

204
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,910
This is equal to the
expectation value

205
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:50,150
of x in the original
state plus x0 times 1.

206
00:14:53,510 --> 00:15:00,790
So the expectation value of x
in the new state, the x0 psi,

207
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:05,920
is the expectation value of
x in the old state plus x0.

208
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,050
So indeed, if this is x, you
could do this for vectors,

209
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,100
and here is x0.

210
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:22,680
Well, the expectation value of
x in the new state, the T x0

211
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:28,800
operator, took the state and
moved it by a displacement x0

212
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,840
so that the new expectation
value is the old one plus x0.

213
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:42,320
So that's physically why
these things are relevant.

214
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:49,420
A couple of other things
you've shown in the homework,

215
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:56,900
and you could retry doing them,
is that T x0 on the x state,

216
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:04,050
by this intuition, should
be the x plus x0 state.

217
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,810
It moves the state to the right.

218
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:18,745
And if psi has a wave
function, psi of x, T x0 of psi

219
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:24,180
has a wave function,
psi of x minus x0,

220
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,860
since you know that
psi of x minus x0

221
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,300
is the wave function
translated by x0 to the right.

222
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,480
The sign is always
the opposite one.

223
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,930
When you write
psi of x minus x0,

224
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,600
the function has been
moved to the right x0.

225
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,410
So this is our whole
discussion and reminder

226
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:52,480
of what the translation
operators are.

227
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,170
So we've got our
translation operator.

228
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,670
Let's see how we can use it.

229
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:01,880
And we'll use it to define
the coherent states.

230
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,715
So here comes the definition
of what the coherent state is.

231
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,069
It's a beginning definition,
or a working definition,

232
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,250
until we understand it enough
that we can generalize it.

233
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,400
By the time we
finish the lecture,

234
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,329
this definition will be
generalized in a very nice way,

235
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,829
in a very elegant way.

236
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,975
So coherent states.

237
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,480
So here it goes.

238
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:43,010
I'm going to take the
vacuum state of the harmonic

239
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,840
oscillator, the ground state
of the harmonic oscillator,

240
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:54,430
and simply displace it with
a translation operator by x0.

241
00:17:54,430 --> 00:18:04,260
So this is going to be e to the
minus i p hat x0 over h bar 0.

242
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,680
And I want a name
for this state,

243
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,190
and that's the worst part of it.

244
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,590
There's no great name for it.

245
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't know if any
notation is very good.

246
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,760
If it's very good,
it's cumbersome,

247
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,890
so I'll write it like this.

248
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,230
A little misleading.

249
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,510
I'll put a tilde over the state.

250
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,490
You could say it's
a tilde over the x,

251
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,430
but it really,
morally speaking, is

252
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,480
a tilde over the whole state.

253
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,440
It means that this
thing, you should

254
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,820
read there's an x0 here used for
the translation operator that

255
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,480
appears here.

256
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,770
So that's the state, x tilde 0.

257
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,100
Intuitively, you
know what it is.

258
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,450
You have the harmonic
oscillator potential.

259
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,910
Here is x.

260
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,640
The ground state is some
wave function like that.

261
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,670
This state has been
moved to position x0,

262
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:11,880
and presumably some sort
of wave function like that,

263
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,670
because this translates
the wave function.

264
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,900
So the ground state moves
it up there to the right.

265
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,260
That's what it is.

266
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,240
That's a coherent state.

267
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,800
And there's no time
dependence here so far,

268
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,020
so this is the state at
some instant of time.

269
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,580
The coherent state, maybe
call it at time equals zero.

270
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,850
Let's leave time frozen
for a little while

271
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,640
until we understand
what this state does.

272
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,190
Then we'll put the time back.

273
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,475
So a few remarks on this.

274
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:58,085
x0 x0 is how much?

275
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,670
Now, don't think these
are position eigenstates.

276
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,380
That's a possible mistake.

277
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,550
That's not a
position eigenstate.

278
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,780
This is a coherent state.

279
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,680
If these would be
position eigenstate,

280
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,220
you say delta of
this minus that,

281
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,890
but it's nothing
to do with that.

282
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,840
Can you tell without
doing any computation what

283
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,330
is this number?

284
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,890
How much should be?

285
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,650
Yes?

286
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,587
AUDIENCE: 1.

287
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:33,920
BARTON ZWIEBACH: It should be 1.

288
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,440
Why?

289
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,630
Because it's a unitary
operator acting on this thing,

290
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,160
so it preserve length.

291
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,100
So this should be equal
to 0 0, should be 1.

292
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,680
Very good.

293
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,550
No need to do the computation.

294
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,710
It's just 1.

295
00:20:50,710 --> 00:21:02,260
Psi associated to this state is
the ground state wave function

296
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,380
at x minus x0.

297
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:14,435
Where this refers to the wave
function, x0 is psi 0 of x.

298
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,400
So this is what I
was saying here.

299
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,830
The wave function
has been translated

300
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:27,670
to x0, the remark over there.

301
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,450
So these are our
coherent states and we

302
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:39,240
want to understand the first
few basic things about them

303
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,435
so we can do the following
simple computations.

304
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,540
So if I have to
do the following,

305
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,500
if I have to compute
the expectation

306
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:04,850
value of any operator,
A, on a coherent state,

307
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:09,180
I use the fact that I want
to go back to the vacuum,

308
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:15,820
so I put T x0 dagger A T x0 0.

309
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:25,360
Because that way, I trace back
to what the vacuum is doing.

310
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,840
It's much easier to do that than
to try to calculate something

311
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,250
from scratch.

312
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:46,830
So for example, we have
here that x0 x x0, well, you

313
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:53,090
would replace it by T x T,
T dagger x T, which you know

314
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,140
is x hat plus x0.

315
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:03,960
We calculated it a few
seconds ago, top blackboard.

316
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,570
And therefore, you got
what is the expectation

317
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,800
value of x on the ground state?

318
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,210
x0, very good.

319
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:18,560
And therefore, we just got x0,
which is what you would expect.

320
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,100
The expectation value of x
on the coherent state is x0.

321
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,270
You're there.

322
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,410
You've been displaced.

323
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:37,080
How about the
momentum, x0 p hat x0?

324
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:43,430
Well, p acted by the translation
operator is unchanged.

325
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:49,570
Therefore, we got 0 p 0, and
again that 0, so this state

326
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:53,330
still has no momentum.

327
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:57,860
It represents a T equals 0,
a state that is over here.

328
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,780
And just by looking at it,
it's just sitting there,

329
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,140
has no momentum whatsoever.

330
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,310
Another question
that is interesting,

331
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:16,201
what is the expectation
value of the Hamiltonian

332
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:18,010
on the coherent state?

333
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:28,640
Well, this should be, now
you imagine in your head,

334
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:37,350
T dagger H T. Now, H
is p squared over 2m,

335
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,800
and that p squared
over 2m gets unchanged.

336
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:49,520
p squared over 2m is not changed
because T dagger and T does

337
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,330
nothing to it, T dagger
from the left, T.

338
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,120
Nevertheless.

339
00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:01,240
the Hamiltonian has a 1/2
m omega squared x hat,

340
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,960
and x hat is changed by
becoming x hat plus x0.

341
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,840
Well, we don't want to
compute too hard, do

342
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,280
too much effort here.

343
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,920
So first, we realize that
here's the p squared over 2m

344
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,070
and here's the m omega squared
x hat squared, so that's

345
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,980
the whole Hamiltonian.

346
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:44,500
So we got 0 H 0 plus the
extra terms that come here.

347
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,720
But what terms come here?

348
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:54,250
There's a product of an x0
and an x between 0 and 0.

349
00:25:54,250 --> 00:26:01,220
x0 is a number, so you have an
x between 0 and 0, and that's 0.

350
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,810
So the cross product here won't
contribute to the expectation

351
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:10,240
value, so the last term
that is there is 1/2 m

352
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,310
is a number omega
squared, x0 squared.

353
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,200
And what is the
expectation value

354
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,890
of the Hamiltonian
on the vacuum?

355
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:28,450
It's h omega over 2 plus 1/2
m omega squared, x0 squared.

356
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:35,000
And you start seeing
classical behavior.

357
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,400
The expectation value of
the energy at this point

358
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,840
is a little quantum
thing plus the whole cost

359
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,080
of stretching something
all the way to x0.

360
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:57,690
1/2 of k squared, k for
the oscillator, x0 squared.

361
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,500
So the energy of this thing is
quite reasonably approximated,

362
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,250
if x0 is large enough,
by the second term,

363
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,870
and this is the cost
of energy of having

364
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,450
a particle of the potential.

365
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,280
So it's behaving in
a reasonable way.

366
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:26,910
You can do a couple more
little exercises that I'll

367
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:35,613
put here as things
for you to check.

368
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:36,113
Exercise.

369
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:44,770
x0 tilde x squared x0 tilde.

370
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,330
Just calculate.

371
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,250
It's just useful to have.

372
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:56,650
x0 squared plus h
bar over 2m omega.

373
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:09,290
And x0 tilde p squared x0
tilde is mh omega over 2.

374
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:21,535
And finally, x0 tilde xp plus
px x0 tilde is equal to 0.

375
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,520
Any questions?

376
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,580
These are exercises
for you to practice

377
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,072
a little these
expectation values.

378
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,700
Questions on what
we've done so far?

379
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,254
Yes?

380
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,739
AUDIENCE: You said
these coherent states is

381
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:47,224
most significant only
in the ground state,

382
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:53,964
or is it also important to
use them for [INAUDIBLE]?

383
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:01,770
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Well, we've
defined the coherent state

384
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:05,110
by taking the ground
state and moving it,

385
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,420
and these are
particularly interesting.

386
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,800
You could try to figure out what
would happen if you would take

387
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,320
an excited state
and you move it.

388
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,410
Things are a little
more complicated.

389
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,360
PROFESSOR: And in a
sense, they can all

390
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,790
be understood in terms of what
we do to the ground state.

391
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:25,190
So we will not focus
on them too much.

392
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,860
In a sense, you will
see when we generalize

393
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:33,430
this how what we're doing
is very special, in at least

394
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,660
one simple way.

395
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:41,040
So we'll always focus on
translating the grounds.

396
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,560
Other questions?

397
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,690
Yes.

398
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,180
AUDIENCE: Where does the
term [INAUDIBLE] arise

399
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,120
and why does it
persevere [INAUDIBLE]

400
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,940
PROFESSOR: OK, here is the
thing of the coherent state.

401
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:00,000
Is this an energy
eigenstate at this moment?

402
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,030
What do you think?

403
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:06,090
Is this an energy eigenstate--
this state over here?

404
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,250
No, it won't be an
energy eigenstate.

405
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,050
There's something
funny about it.

406
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:15,010
Energy eigenstates are
always diffuse things.

407
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,050
They never look like that.

408
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,970
So this is not an
energy eigenstate,

409
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,820
and you've done things with
non-energy eigenstates.

410
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,430
They change shape.

411
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:28,950
As they evolve,
they change shape.

412
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:32,160
What we will see very
soon is that this state,

413
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:37,170
if we let it go, it will
start moving back and forth

414
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,630
without changing shape.

415
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,450
It's going to do
an amazing thing.

416
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,120
Energy eigenstates-- you're
super-close to energy

417
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,870
eigenstates.

418
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:50,710
You get something that changes
in time and the shape changes,

419
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,210
and you've even done
problems like that.

420
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:58,620
But this state is so
exceptional that even

421
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,815
as we let it go in time,
it's going to change,

422
00:31:01,815 --> 00:31:05,740
but the shape is not
going to spread out.

423
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,440
Do you remember when
you considered a pulse

424
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,270
in a free particle, how it
disappears and stretches away?

425
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,460
Well, in the
harmonic oscillator,

426
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,340
this has been so well prepared
that this thing, as time goes

427
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,660
by, will just move and
oscillate like a particle.

428
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,350
And it does so coherently.

429
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,430
It doesn't change shape.

430
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:32,780
When we talk about
light, coherent light

431
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,610
is what you get from lasers.

432
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,500
And so if you want
understand lasers,

433
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,230
you have to understand
coherent states.

434
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:46,140
OK, so this brings us
there to time evolution.

435
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,376
So let's do time evolution.

436
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,760
So what will happen?

437
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:16,440
We'll have a state x0
goes to x0 comma t.

438
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,880
So that's the notation.

439
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,530
That's what we'll mean by
the state at a later time.

440
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,510
And how are we going
to explore this?

441
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,290
Well, we're all set with our
Heisenberg operator, there.

442
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,410
We'll take expectation
values of things

443
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,420
to figure out how things look.

444
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,300
So what do we have here?

445
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:46,550
We'll ask for X0 t, and we'll
put the Schrodinger operator

446
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:50,910
in between here--
X0 t, and this is

447
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,760
what we'll call the
expectation value of A

448
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,230
as time goes by
in the X0 0 state.

449
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,120
This is what we call this.

450
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,720
But then, we have
the time evolution.

451
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:14,320
So this is equal to the original
state, Heisenberg operator

452
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,785
of A-- original state.

453
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:26,460
And if you wish, you could
then put the t operator--

454
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,280
as we have in the top
blackboard to the right--

455
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,130
and reduce it even more.

456
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:37,930
But we've computed a lot of
this coherent state expectation

457
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:41,510
value, so let's
leave it like that.

458
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,810
So you could, if
you wish, say this

459
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:56,970
is equal to 0-- T
X0 dagger A T X0 0.

460
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:01,080
So you can ultimately reduce
the expectation values

461
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,810
of things on the vacuum.

462
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,680
So OK, we're all set.

463
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,125
Let's try to do one.

464
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,960
And the reason this
is a nice calculation

465
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,820
is that the time
evolution of this state

466
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,370
is a little complicated.

467
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:26,540
We'll figure it out
later, but it's easier

468
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,449
to work with the
time evolved state.

469
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:31,820
So here it goes-- what
is the expectation

470
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:40,120
value of X as a function
of time on the X0 state?

471
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,620
Well, it says here
take the X0 state,

472
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,739
and take the
Heisenberg value of X.

473
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:56,960
So we have it up there-- X
hat cosine omega t plus b hat

474
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,260
over M omega sine omega t X0.

475
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,630
Forget about time evolution
of the coherent states.

476
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,240
We evolved the operator.

477
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,510
On the other hand, we have
that the expectation value of p

478
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:19,090
is 0 in the coherent state,
and the expectation value of X

479
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,980
is X0.

480
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:27,760
So end of story-- calculation
over-- X0 cosine of omega t.

481
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,630
That's expectation
value in time.

482
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,806
This thing is
oscillating classically.

483
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:39,300
That's nice as can be.

484
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:46,720
So classical behavior
again, of a quantum state.

485
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:55,690
How about expectation
value of p X0 of t?

486
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,535
If it's oscillating,
it better be moving,

487
00:35:58,535 --> 00:36:00,720
and it better have
some momentum.

488
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,430
So let's put the
momentum operator here,

489
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,110
the Heisenberg one.

490
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:14,500
So we'll have p hat cosine
omega t minus m omega x

491
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:22,160
hat sine omega t X0 tilde.

492
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,080
And this is 0, but
X has X0 there,

493
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:35,510
so minus m omega X0
sine of omega t, which

494
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:46,110
is equal to m d dt of the
expectation value of X.

495
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:50,430
Here it is-- expectation
value of X. m d dt of that

496
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,900
is minus m omega
X0 sine omega t.

497
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,220
That's what it should be.

498
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,760
And this thing is really
oscillating classically--

499
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,330
not only the exposition, but
the momentum is doing that.

500
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,750
Now, the other thing
that we can compute--

501
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:15,650
and we want to compute--
is the key thing.

502
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,110
You have this state.

503
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,420
We said it's coherent evolution.

504
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,800
So the ground
state is this state

505
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,190
that is a minimum
uncertainty packet.

506
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:31,800
It has a delta X uncertainty
mix and a delta p.

507
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,280
Their product saturates the
uncertainty in equality.

508
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,710
And when we move the state
X0, well, the delta X

509
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,650
will be the same.

510
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,970
The delta p will be the
same, and it's that.

511
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:49,730
But now as it starts
to move, we want

512
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,630
to see if the shape
is kept the same.

513
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:56,100
Maybe it fattens up,
and shrinks down,

514
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,770
and does things in the middle.

515
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:02,200
So the issue of
coherency of this state

516
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,270
is the issue whether the
uncertainties remain the same.

517
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,670
If the uncertainties
remain the same,

518
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:13,070
and they are saturated--
the product is saturating

519
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:17,700
the inequality, you know that
the shape has to be Gaussian,

520
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:22,210
and it must be the same
shape that is running around.

521
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:28,570
So what we need to compute
is the uncertainty in X,

522
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,800
for example.

523
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:42,130
So how do delta X of t
and delta p of p behave?

524
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,220
That's our question.

525
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,305
And let's see how they do.

526
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,060
Well, we have this
computation-- actually,

527
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,640
if you don't have the
Heisenberg picture,

528
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,930
it's kind of a nightmare.

529
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:07,450
With the Heisenberg
picture, it's a lot easier.

530
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:12,250
Delta x squared of t
would be the expectation

531
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:21,120
value of X0 t of
X squared, X0 t,

532
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:30,790
minus the expectation value
of X0 t X, X0 t squared.

533
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,396
I wrote what the definition
of the uncertainty squared is.

534
00:39:39,396 --> 00:39:43,450
It's the expectation value
of the operator squared,

535
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,330
minus the square
of the expectation

536
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,250
value of the operator.

537
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,390
And of course, everything
is going to turn Heisenberg

538
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:57,490
immediately, so this thing--
maybe I can go one more

539
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:08,070
line here-- would be X0 X
Heisenberg squared of t,

540
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:16,170
X0 minus-- this is simple--
this we've calculated.

541
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:20,010
it's that expectation
value at the top

542
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:23,530
is the expectation
value of X in time.

543
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,250
It's that.

544
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:29,650
So this is minus X0 squared
cosine squared of omega t.

545
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,680
So what do we have to do?

546
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,670
We have to focus on this term.

547
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:50,960
So this term is equal to X0.

548
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,430
And you have X
Heisenberg squared,

549
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:57,590
so let's do it-- X
squared cosine squared

550
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:04,550
omega t plus p
hat squared over m

551
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:12,810
squared w squared sine
squared omega t plus 1

552
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:28,240
over mw cosine omega t sine
omega t X p plus pX X0 tilde.

553
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,500
That shows that term, and
I just squared that thing,

554
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:41,260
but that I suggested
a few exercises here.

555
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,340
This is 0.

556
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:48,770
In fact, it's 0 in the ground
state as well, so this is 0.

557
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:57,410
X squared gives you
the top equation--

558
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:05,420
X0 squared plus h bar
over 2 m omega cosine

559
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:21,040
squared omega t-- plus p squared
over m squared w squared,

560
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,730
so p squared is
m h omega over 2.

561
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:28,590
And then you have
m squared omega

562
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,860
squared sine squared omega t.

563
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:38,470
And that's this whole term.

564
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:41,020
And the thing that
we're supposed to do

565
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:45,370
is subtract this here.

566
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:51,210
You see that the X0 squared
cosine squared of omega t

567
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,130
cancels here.

568
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:58,810
So what do we get?

569
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:03,680
h bar over 2 mw cosine
squared omega t.

570
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:13,980
But this thing is also h bar
over 2 mw sine squared omega t.

571
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,890
So this whole
thing, all the times

572
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:20,840
have disappeared--
delta X squared--

573
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,410
the time dependence here
has disappeared with that,

574
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:28,090
and the cosine squared with
sine squared have combined,

575
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:33,050
and you get h bar
over 2 m omega, which

576
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:38,500
was-- this is, I'm sorry, of t.

577
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,000
We work very hard
to put the t there.

578
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,970
We should leave it.

579
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:48,080
The uncertainty as a function
of time has not changed.

580
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,160
It is the original uncertainty
of the ground state.

581
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,030
So this is moving in a nice way.

582
00:43:55,030 --> 00:44:00,790
You're supposed to compute now
as well the uncertainty in p.

583
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:04,050
I leave that as an
exercise-- delta

584
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:14,180
p squared of t equal
m h bar omega over 2.

585
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,290
So this is an exercise.

586
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,560
Practice with coherent states.

587
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,520
It's worth doing it, I think.

588
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,170
Actually there's going to
be a problem in the homework

589
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:31,570
set, in which you're going to
ask to do most of these things,

590
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,970
including things I'm doing
here on the blackboard.

591
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:37,350
So you will practice this.

592
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:46,230
So between these two, delta
p, delta X-- delta X of t,

593
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:52,760
delta p of t is, in fact,
equal to h bar over 2.

594
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,190
And this is a minimum
uncertainty thing.

595
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:58,750
And it behaves quite nicely.

596
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,950
All right, so the name
coherent now should make sense.

597
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:09,480
You've produced a
quantum state that

598
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,790
has about the energy of a state
that you're familiar with,

599
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:18,310
and it moves classically,
and it doesn't change shape

600
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:20,575
as it moves, so
it moves coherent.

601
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,870
So our next task,
therefore, will

602
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:30,390
be to understand this
in the energy basis.

603
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:34,990
Because in the energy basis,
it looks like a miracle.

604
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,980
You've suddenly
managed to produce

605
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,020
a set of states of
different energies,

606
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:44,150
created the superposition,
and suddenly, it

607
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,620
moves in a nice way.

608
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,450
Why does that happen?

609
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:51,550
So we need to understand
the energy basis.

610
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,560
And as we do that,
we'll understand

611
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:58,090
how to generalize the
coherent states completely.

612
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:02,690
So let's go on with
that, and let's

613
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:04,860
explore this in
the energy basis.

614
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:23,985
So what do we have?

615
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:33,940
We have the coherent state--
no need to put the time yet--

616
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:42,000
is e to the exponential of
minus i p hat X0 over h bar.

617
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,940
There is, as you've
seen already,

618
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:53,040
at length scale in the harmonic
oscillator-- famous length

619
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:58,580
scale, and we'll have
an abbreviation for it.

620
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:06,060
It's the length scale d0
squared h bar over m omega.

621
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:11,850
You can use the parameters of
the harmonic oscillator-- h bar

622
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:14,820
and m and omega-- to
produce a length scale.

623
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,110
And that length scale is d0.

624
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:24,930
It's essentially the uncertainty
in the position in the ground

625
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:28,770
state, up to the
square root of 2.

626
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:32,930
It's the way-- you want to
construct a length-- there

627
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:36,060
it is-- the only way you
can construct a length.

628
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,480
So I'm going to
use that notation.

629
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:49,330
So let me put what the p is into
that formula, and simplify it.

630
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:53,830
So this is on the vacuum-- I'm
sorry, I stopped half the way.

631
00:47:53,830 --> 00:48:02,590
So this is the exponential of X0
over square root of 2d a dagger

632
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:07,325
minus a on the vacuum.

633
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:18,800
Plug in the p, get
the h bars, and you

634
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,710
will see that d
enters in that way.

635
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:27,740
It's the way it has to enter,
because this exponential should

636
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:32,850
have no units, and therefore
X0 over d0 has no units,

637
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:36,820
and the a's and the a
daggers have no units.

638
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:40,640
So it couldn't be any
way different like that.

639
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,960
The i also shouldn't be
there, because this operator--

640
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,550
the i was there to make
this anti-Hermitian.

641
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:55,942
But this, with this real,
is already anti-Hermitian.

642
00:48:55,942 --> 00:48:57,150
You see, you take the dagger.

643
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:59,450
It becomes minus itself.

644
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:01,250
So this is anti-Hermitian.

645
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:05,280
No need for an i-- in
fact, an i would be wrong,

646
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,660
so there's no i.

647
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,630
And that's this.

648
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:17,780
Now, we want to figure out how
this looks in the energy basis,

649
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:23,630
so what are we going to do?

650
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,370
We're going to have
to do something

651
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:27,610
with that exponential.

652
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:29,710
We're going to
have to reorder it.

653
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,520
This is a job for
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff.

654
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:38,660
Which one?

655
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:45,600
Well, this one-- e to the X
plus Y is equal to e to X,

656
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:50,670
e to the Y, e to
the minus 1/2-- I

657
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:59,510
don't know this by heart--
XY, and it stops there.

658
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:06,460
If and only if X commutator
with Y commutes with X,

659
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,100
and commutes with Y.

660
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:13,700
There was a problem
in the test that there

661
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,690
was an operator with
Xp plus pX acting on X,

662
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:22,630
and after you commuted,
you get X again,

663
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:25,830
and you have to keep
including terms.

664
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:40,410
So this stops here if XY
commutes with X and Y.

665
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:42,330
And why do I want this?

666
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:46,990
Because I actually want
to split the creation

667
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:49,150
and the manipulation operators.

668
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:53,630
I want them in
separate exponentials.

669
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:59,650
We have that energy eigenstates
are creation operators

670
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:05,080
on the vacuum, but here I have
creation minus destruction.

671
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,500
So if I expand the
exponential, I'm

672
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,030
going to get lots of
creation and destruction,

673
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:14,510
and I'm going to spend
hours trying to sort it out.

674
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:19,460
If you did expand it, I bet
you won't see it through

675
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:22,920
so easily-- probably
will take you forever,

676
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,440
and it might not work out.

677
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,520
So expanding an
exponential is something

678
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,480
that we should be
reluctant to do.

679
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,500
On the other hand,
this is a nice option,

680
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,810
because then you
think of this as e

681
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:47,310
to the X0 over square root
of 2d0 a dagger minus X0

682
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:49,525
over square root of 2d0 a.

683
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:03,820
And I chose this analogy X
with this, and Y with this.

684
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:08,300
It's like Y is this thing
minus that, and X is that.

685
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,360
You could have done it
the other way around,

686
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,510
but then you would run
into trouble again.

687
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:14,440
Why?

688
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:21,040
Because I want a Y factor
that has the manipulators

689
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,480
to be to the right of the X
factor that has the creation.

690
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,240
Why?

691
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:33,740
Because if I have annihilators
closer to the vacuum,

692
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,100
that's good.

693
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:40,110
Annihilators closer to the
vacuum is what you really want,

694
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:42,840
because if you have creators
close to the vacuum,

695
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,290
they create state, but then
you have the manipulators,

696
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,640
and you have to start
working them out.

697
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,590
On the other hand,
if the annihilators

698
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:52,880
are close to the vacuum,
they just kill the vacuum

699
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,020
and you can forget them.

700
00:52:55,020 --> 00:53:00,130
So it's very important that
you identify X with this,

701
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:03,840
and Y with this whole thing.

702
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:18,830
So that this is e to the X0 over
square root of 2D0 a dagger, e

703
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:26,470
to the minus X0 over
square root of 2d0 a.

704
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:29,860
And now you're supposed to do
the commutator of these two

705
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,600
things.

706
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,560
And the commutator
is the commutator

707
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:39,140
of an a dagger with
an a, and that is 1.

708
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:44,860
So this commutator is
a number-- crucial,

709
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,850
because if it wasn't
a number, if it

710
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,680
would be an a or an a
dagger, it would not

711
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:54,320
commute with a, X, and Y, and
you have to include more terms.

712
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,190
So the fact that this
commutator is a number

713
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:59,680
allows you to use this formula.

714
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:05,960
So now we'll put this
factor here, minus 1/2.

715
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,370
Then you have X
with Y, and that's

716
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:17,740
X0 minus X0 over square
root of 2d squared,

717
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:20,610
minus-- and this factor
squared-- an a dagger

718
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:22,620
with a, which is minus 1.

719
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,860
So that's that whole operator.

720
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,860
So let's write it.

721
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:40,550
The coherent state,
therefore, X0 tilde,

722
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:47,610
is equal to e to the X0 over
square root of 2d0 a hat

723
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:55,390
dagger, e to the minus X0
over square root of 2d0 a,

724
00:54:55,390 --> 00:55:04,130
and this factor that seems
to be e to the minus 1/4 X0

725
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:07,420
squared over d0 squared.

726
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:12,340
And here is this nice vacuum.

727
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,770
Yes, factor is right.

728
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:17,680
So what is this?

729
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:22,540
Well, this is a number, so
I can pull it to the left.

730
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:27,280
And here is the exponential
of the annihilator operator.

731
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,480
Now expand the exponential.

732
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,680
It's 1.

733
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,900
That survives, but the first
term has an a-- kills it.

734
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,120
The second term has an
a squared-- kills it.

735
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,260
Everything kills it.

736
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:44,640
This thing acting on
the vacuum is just 1.

737
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,380
That's why this is simple.

738
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,920
So what have we got?

739
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:56,290
In the state X0 tilde is e
to the minus 1/4 X0 squared

740
00:55:56,290 --> 00:56:04,660
over d0 squared times e to
the X0 over square root of 2d0

741
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,115
a dagger on the vacuum.

742
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:22,700
Well this is nice-- not
quite energy eigenstates,

743
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,480
but we're almost there.

744
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,050
What is this?

745
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:33,780
e to the minus 1/4, X0
squared over d0 squared.

746
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,210
And now expand.

747
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:39,850
This is the sum from n
equals 1 to infinity,

748
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:43,600
1 over n factorial.

749
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,948
X0 over square root
of 2d0 to the n,

750
00:56:47,948 --> 00:56:52,530
a hat dagger to the
n on the vacuum.

751
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:02,680
And what was the nth
energy eigenstate?

752
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,000
You probably remember.

753
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,130
The nth energy
eigenstate is a dagger

754
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:12,370
to the n on the vacuum over
square root of n factorial.

755
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:16,320
So we've got a little
more than the square root

756
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,560
of 2 n factorial.

757
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:22,480
So maybe I'll do it here.

758
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:31,450
We get e to the minus 1/4
X0 squared over d0 squared,

759
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:42,300
sum from n equals
1 to infinity, 1

760
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:51,410
over square root of n factorial,
X0 over the square root of 2 d0

761
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:55,610
to the n times the
nth energy eigenstate.

762
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:07,180
It's a little messy,
but not so bad.

763
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:10,080
I think actually I
won't need that anymore.

764
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,445
Well no, I may.

765
00:58:11,445 --> 00:58:11,945
I will.

766
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:22,650
So let's write it maybe again.

767
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:25,630
Well, it's OK.

768
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:30,540
Let's write it as
follows-- Cn n.

769
00:58:37,144 --> 00:58:42,950
OK, so I got some cn's and n's.

770
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:46,600
So this is a very
precise superposition

771
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:51,040
of energy eigenstates,
very delicate superposition

772
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,290
of energy eigenstates.

773
00:58:54,290 --> 00:59:00,610
Let me write it in the
following way-- cn squared.

774
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,200
Why would I care
about cn squared?

775
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:13,940
cn squared is the probability
to find the coherent state

776
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:17,020
in the nth energy eigenstate.

777
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:21,540
The amplitude to have it in the
nth energy eigenstate is cn.

778
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:26,020
So that probability to find it
in the nth energy eigenstate

779
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:34,080
is cn squared, is the
probability 4x tilde 0

780
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:39,680
2b in the nth energy eigenstate.

781
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,800
That is what?

782
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:50,220
Exponential of minus 1/2
x0 squared over d0 squared.

783
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,770
And I have to square that.

784
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:56,322
So I have 1 over n factorial.

785
00:59:56,322 --> 00:59:58,980
I have to square that
coefficient there.

786
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:03,970
So it's x0 squared over
2d0 squared-- that's

787
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:06,700
nice, it's the same
one here-- to the n.

788
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:17,210
So it's easier to
think of this if you

789
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:28,410
invent a new letter, lambda, to
be x0 squared over 2d0 squared.

790
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:39,850
Then, cn squared is equal to
e to the minus lambda lambda

791
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:42,170
to the n over n factorial.

792
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,680
Yes.

793
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,039
AUDIENCE: Is that
something that we

794
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:13,532
should expect to be true
for any time of [INAUDIBLE],

795
01:01:13,532 --> 01:01:15,528
or is that something
that we [INAUDIBLE]?

796
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:24,120
PROFESSOR: Well, let
me say it this way.

797
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,400
In a second, it
will become clear

798
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,280
that this was almost necessary.

799
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:35,050
I actually don't know very
deeply why this is true.

800
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:38,570
And I'm always a little puzzled
and uncomfortable at this point

801
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,840
in 805.

802
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,925
So what is really
strange about this

803
01:01:43,925 --> 01:01:47,245
is that this is the so-called
Poisson distribution.

804
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:53,290
So there's something about
this energy eigenstate

805
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:58,270
that their Poisson distributed
in a coherent state.

806
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:04,150
So these are probabilities,
as I claimed, to find an n.

807
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:09,750
And indeed, let's check the
sum of the cn squareds from n

808
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:12,410
equals 1 to infinity.

809
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:13,500
Let's see what it is.

810
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,734
And you will see, you
cannot tinker with this.

811
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,530
This is e to the minus
lambda the sum from n

812
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:26,850
equals 1 to infinity lambda
to the n over n factorial.

813
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:29,810
And that sum-- it's
not from n equals 1.

814
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:32,370
It's 0 to infinity, I'm sorry.

815
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:34,750
Did I write once anywhere?

816
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:37,940
Yeah, it should be 0.

817
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,425
OK, this is 0.

818
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:49,290
There is the ground state, so
from n equals 0 to infinity.

819
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:52,090
And this is e to
the minus lambda e

820
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:54,030
to the lambda, which is 1.

821
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:01,390
So yes, this is
Poisson distributed.

822
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:07,930
It's some sort of
distribution like that.

823
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:18,470
So if you have the n's, the
cn's, Poisson distributions

824
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:22,485
have to do with if you have
a radioactive material.

825
01:03:22,485 --> 01:03:24,030
It has a lifetime.

826
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:26,870
And you say, how many
events should I--

827
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:28,690
the lifetime is five years.

828
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:32,850
How many events should you
expect to happen in a week?

829
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,130
These are Poisson distributed.

830
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,740
So it's a Poisson distribution.

831
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:43,930
It's a very nice thing.

832
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:49,160
So let me just make one
more remark about it.

833
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:56,530
And it's quite something.

834
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:08,380
So one question
that you could ask

835
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:13,130
is, what is the most probable n?

836
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:15,030
That's a good question.

837
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:17,026
You have a coherent state.

838
01:04:17,026 --> 01:04:18,650
So it's going to have
the superposition

839
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:20,570
of the vacuum, the first.

840
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:27,300
What is the most probable n,
so the expectation value of n?

841
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:30,960
Now, I'm thinking of
it probabilistically.

842
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,916
So I'm thinking this is a
probability distribution.

843
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:40,020
Then, I will show it for
you that this is really

844
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:41,390
computing what you want.

845
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:46,270
But probabilistically, what
is the expectation value of n?

846
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:49,995
You should sum n times the
probability that you get n.

847
01:04:53,590 --> 01:05:02,160
So this is sum over ne to
the minus lambda lambda

848
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,570
to the n over n factorial.

849
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:07,152
So you got an n there.

850
01:05:07,152 --> 01:05:11,410
And the way you get an n there--
well, the e to the minus lambda

851
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:14,100
goes out.

852
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:18,230
And the n can be reproduced
by doing lambda d d

853
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:20,670
lambda on the sum.

854
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:27,630
Because lambda d d lambda on
this sum brings down this n,

855
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:31,380
puts back the lambda so it
gives you the thing you had,

856
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:32,700
and that's what it is.

857
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:38,485
So here, you get e to
the minus lambda lambda

858
01:05:38,485 --> 01:05:44,280
d d lambda of e to the lambda.

859
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:47,730
And that is lambda, OK?

860
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:59,765
So the expectation value of
the most sort of not the peak,

861
01:05:59,765 --> 01:06:05,590
but the expected value of n in
this distribution, the level

862
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:08,980
that you're going to be
excited is basically lambda.

863
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:16,140
So if x0 is 1,000
times bigger than d0,

864
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:22,290
you've moved this thing 1,000
times the quantum uncertainty.

865
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:26,010
Then, you're occupying
most strongly the levels

866
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:29,160
at 1 million.

867
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:37,590
You get x0 over d0 controls
which n is the most likely.

868
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:41,140
Indeed, look, this
n-- suppose you

869
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:48,375
would compute x0
tilde n hat x0 tilde.

870
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:56,290
This is what you would think
is an occupation number.

871
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:59,110
This sounds a little hand wavy.

872
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:02,890
But this is the number
operator, the expected value

873
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:06,030
of the number operator,
in the coherent state.

874
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:12,410
But this is-- you have that
the coherent state is this.

875
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:15,640
So let's substitute
that in there.

876
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:19,860
So you get two sums
over n and over m.

877
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:32,500
And you would have
cm star m N n cn.

878
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:37,030
I've substituted
x0 and x0 dagger.

879
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:40,140
The c's in fact are real.

880
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:44,240
And then, the number
operator on here is little n.

881
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,380
And then, you get
the Kronecker delta.

882
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:53,690
So this is sum over n
and m cmcn-- it's real.

883
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:57,880
And then, you get n delta m, n.

884
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:03,800
So this is in fact the
sum over ncn squared.

885
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,780
So what we wrote
here, this is really

886
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:09,195
the expectation value
of the number operator.

887
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:17,040
And one can do more
calculations here.

888
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,229
A calculation that is
particularly interesting

889
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:24,109
to discover what
these states look like

890
01:08:24,109 --> 01:08:30,069
is the uncertainty
in the energy.

891
01:08:30,069 --> 01:08:36,060
So that's another sort
of relevant measure.

892
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:39,180
How big is the
uncertainty in the energy?

893
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:48,200
What are, basically,
the delta E associated

894
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,510
to the coherent state?

895
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:52,720
How does it look like?

896
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,795
Is it very sharp?

897
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:59,490
So it's a good question.

898
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:02,220
And it's in the notes.

899
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:05,399
I leave it for you to
try to calculate it.

900
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:14,080
Delta E in the coherent
state x0, how much is it?

901
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:18,029
And it turns out to be
the following-- h omega

902
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:20,384
x0 over square root of 2d.

903
01:09:24,689 --> 01:09:28,160
So actually, maybe this
is a little surprising.

904
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:37,529
But delta E over h omega
is equal to x0 over d.

905
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:46,689
So actually, the
energy uncertainty

906
01:09:46,689 --> 01:09:50,180
for a classical look in
coherent state-- I'm sorry,

907
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:52,189
I'm missing a square
root of 2 there.

908
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:00,020
So what is a classical
looking coherent state?

909
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:05,580
It's a state in which x0 is
much bigger than the quantum d.

910
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:09,450
So x0 is much bigger than d.

911
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:17,530
So in that case, this is a large
number for a classical state--

912
01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:21,480
"classical" state.

913
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:26,480
But in that case, the
uncertainty in delta E

914
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:31,280
is really big compared
to the spacing

915
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,540
of the harmonic oscillator.

916
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:37,150
So you have-- here
is the ground state.

917
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:39,270
Here is h omega.

918
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:43,040
Here is the coherent
state, maybe.

919
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:48,740
And you have a lot of energy
levels that are excited.

920
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:52,730
So if x0 over this
is 1,000, well,

921
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:57,740
at least 1,000 energy
levels are excited.

922
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:01,810
But you shouldn't
fear that too much.

923
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:07,960
Because at the same time,
the expectation value of E

924
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:11,980
over delta E-- the
expectation of E

925
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:15,120
is something we calculated at
the beginning of the lecture.

926
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,520
You have the
oscillator displaced.

927
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:23,320
So this is roughly 1/2 m
omega squared x0 squared.

928
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,310
Throw away the
ground state energy.

929
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:27,570
That's supposed
to be very little.

930
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:33,920
Delta E is h bar omega
x0 over square root of 2.

931
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,265
And this is, again,
the same ratio.

932
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:46,620
So yes, this state
is very funny.

933
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:52,990
It contains an uncertainty that
measured in harmonic oscillator

934
01:11:52,990 --> 01:11:56,080
levels contains many levels.

935
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:01,280
But still, the uncertainty
is much smaller

936
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:05,490
by the same amount than
the average energy.

937
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:10,510
So this state is a state of
some almost definite energy,

938
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:12,830
the uncertainty
being much smaller.

939
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:15,020
But even though
it's much smaller,

940
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:19,500
it still contains a lot of
levels of the oscillator.

941
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:28,510
So that I think gives you a
reasonable picture of this.

942
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:32,010
So you're ready for
a generalization.

943
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:37,890
This is a time to generalize
the coherent states

944
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:40,220
and produce the set
of coherent states

945
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:45,073
that are most useful
eventually, and most flexible.

946
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:50,560
And we do them as follows.

947
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:59,290
We basically are
inspired by this formula

948
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:01,020
to write the following operator.

949
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,760
And here, we change notation.

950
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,500
This x0 was here.

951
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,420
But now we'll introduce
what is called

952
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:16,190
the alpha coherent state.

953
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:19,860
Most general coherent
state is going

954
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:26,070
to be obtained by acted with a
unitary operator on the vacuum.

955
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:30,126
So far so good-- D
of alpha unitary.

956
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:39,070
But now generalize
what you have there.

957
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:42,630
Here, you put a minus
a dagger minus a,

958
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:46,030
because that was anti-Hermitian,
and you put the real constant.

959
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:52,580
Now this alpha will belong
to the complex numbers.

960
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:56,430
Quantum mechanics is all
about complex numbers.

961
01:13:56,430 --> 01:14:00,570
You've got complex vector
spaces, complex numbers.

962
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:02,040
It's all over the place.

963
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,660
So how do we do this?

964
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:10,630
We do this exponential
of alpha a dagger.

965
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:13,360
And I want it to
be anti-Hermitian.

966
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:24,580
So I should put minus
alpha star a on the vacuum.

967
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:29,180
This thing for alpha
equals-- this real number

968
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:31,060
reduces to that.

969
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:34,720
But now, with
alpha complex, it's

970
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,210
a little more
complicated operator.

971
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:39,460
And it's more general.

972
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:42,770
But it's still unitary.

973
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,840
And it preserves a norm.

974
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:49,280
And its most of what you
want from these states.

975
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,660
So the first thing
you do to figure out

976
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:58,740
what this operator does
is to calculate something

977
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:03,410
that maybe you would not
expect it to be simple.

978
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:06,740
But it's worth doing.

979
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:11,330
What is a acting
on the alpha state?

980
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:19,590
Well, I would have
to do a acting

981
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:26,060
on this exponential of
alpha a dagger minus alpha

982
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:29,480
star a on the vacuum.

983
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:39,350
Now, a kills the vacuum.

984
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:43,460
So maybe you're accustomed
already to the next step.

985
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:47,470
I can replace that
product by a commutator.

986
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:50,640
Because the other ordering is 0.

987
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,050
So this is equal
to the commutator.

988
01:15:54,050 --> 01:16:00,060
Because the other term when a is
on the other side is 0 anyway.

989
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:02,900
And now I have to
compute the commutator

990
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,535
of a with an exponential.

991
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,160
Again, it's a little scary.

992
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:16,586
But A with an
exponential e to the B--

993
01:16:16,586 --> 01:16:19,990
it's in the formula sheet,
this Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff

994
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:37,080
again-- is A, B e to the
B if A, B commutes with B.

995
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:47,310
Well, this is A.
This is B. A with B

996
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:53,920
is-- A with B, the
exponent-- just alpha times 1

997
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:54,670
because of this.

998
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:55,590
So it's a number.

999
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:57,770
So this is safe.

1000
01:16:57,770 --> 01:17:01,306
So you get alpha times
the same exponential.

1001
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:07,180
But the same exponential
means the state

1002
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:14,120
alpha-- a little
quick, isn't it?

1003
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:20,190
OK, A with B, this
factor, was alpha.

1004
01:17:20,190 --> 01:17:26,160
And e to the B anyway on the
vacuum is the state alpha.

1005
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:28,910
So there you go.

1006
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,665
You have achieved
the impossible.

1007
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:37,375
You've diagonalized a
non-Hermitian operator.

1008
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,080
This is not Hermitian, and
you found its eigenvalues.

1009
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,850
How could that happen?

1010
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:52,340
Well, it can happen.

1011
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:54,350
But then, all of the
theorems that you

1012
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:58,290
like about Hermitian
operators don't hold.

1013
01:17:58,290 --> 01:17:59,810
So it's a fluke.

1014
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:01,350
This can be done.

1015
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:05,860
But then, states that correspond
to different eigenvalues

1016
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:08,770
will not be orthogonal,
and they will not

1017
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:11,680
form a complete set
of states, and nothing

1018
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:16,220
will be quite as you
may think it would be.

1019
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:19,450
But still, it's quite remarkable
that this can be done.

1020
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:26,610
So this characterizes the
coherent state in a nice way.

1021
01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:29,600
They're eigenstates of
the destruction operator.

1022
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,310
And they're the most
general exponentials

1023
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:40,500
of creation and annihilation
operators acting on the vacuum.

1024
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:49,000
Now, we knew that when alpha
is real, it has to do with x0.

1025
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,520
So we've put a complex alpha.

1026
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,440
What will it do?

1027
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:59,650
A complex alpha,
what it does is gives

1028
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:03,570
the original coherent
state some momentum.

1029
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:06,760
Remember, the original
state that we had was an x0.

1030
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,490
And how did it move?

1031
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:11,100
x0 cosine of omega t.

1032
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:14,550
So at time equals 0,
it had 0 momentum.

1033
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:19,150
This creates a
coherent state at x0,

1034
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:21,980
and it gives it a
momentum controlled

1035
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:25,170
by the imaginary
part of this thing.

1036
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:28,250
In fact, we can do
this as follows.

1037
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:30,460
You can ask, what
is the expectation

1038
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:33,960
value of x in this state?

1039
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:37,660
Well, x is written here.

1040
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:49,041
It's d over square root of 2
alpha a plus a dagger alpha.

1041
01:19:49,041 --> 01:19:53,160
And look, these are
easy to compute.

1042
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:57,110
a gives an alpha,
gives you alpha.

1043
01:19:57,110 --> 01:20:00,380
a dagger and alpha, you
don't know what it is.

1044
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:05,620
But a dagger on [? brau ?]
alpha is alpha star.

1045
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:07,940
So this one you
know on the right.

1046
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:10,980
This one you know on the left.

1047
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:16,070
It gives you the over
square root of 2 alpha plus

1048
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:17,880
alpha star.

1049
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:23,670
So it's square root
of 2d real of alpha.

1050
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:28,535
So the real part of alpha is
the expectation value of x.

1051
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,475
So I'll go here.

1052
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:43,840
I'm almost done-- waiting
for the punch line.

1053
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:52,740
Similarly, you can calculate
the expectation value

1054
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:55,111
of the momentum.

1055
01:20:55,111 --> 01:21:00,010
It will be alpha p alpha.

1056
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:02,620
And p is a minus a dagger.

1057
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:07,230
So you're going to get
alpha star minus alpha, so

1058
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:08,770
the imaginary part.

1059
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:15,310
So p is actually
square root of 2 h

1060
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:20,570
bar over d imaginary
part of alpha.

1061
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:22,250
So the physics is clear.

1062
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:24,920
Maybe the formulas
are a little messy.

1063
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:31,005
But when you have an alpha,
the real part of alpha

1064
01:21:31,005 --> 01:21:34,590
is telling you where you're
positioning the coherent state.

1065
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:37,020
The imaginary part
of alpha is telling

1066
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:39,450
what kick are you giving to it.

1067
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:43,690
And you now have produced the
most general coherent state.

1068
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:49,490
So how do we describe
that geometrically?

1069
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:51,655
We imagine it, the alpha plane.

1070
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:57,970
And here it is.

1071
01:21:57,970 --> 01:22:02,810
The alpha plane, here is the
vector, the complex number

1072
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:06,530
alpha that you've chosen
maybe for your state,

1073
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:09,970
some particular
complex value alpha.

1074
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:13,100
On the x-axis, the
real part of alpha

1075
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:20,020
is the expectation value of
x over square root of 2d.

1076
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:22,970
The real part of alpha
is the expectation value

1077
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:25,620
of x over square root of 2d.

1078
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:29,670
And the imaginary part of
alpha is the expectation value

1079
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:35,950
of p over square
root of 2 h bar d.

1080
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:43,120
And there it is, your
state at time equals 0.

1081
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:49,880
What is it going to
do a little later?

1082
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:52,080
Well, that will
be the last thing

1083
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,610
I want to calculate for you.

1084
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:56,675
It's a nice answer.

1085
01:22:56,675 --> 01:22:58,820
And you should see it.

1086
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:01,555
It's going to take
me two minutes.

1087
01:23:04,290 --> 01:23:05,990
And what is it?

1088
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:12,180
Well, alpha at time t, you
have to evolve the state-- e

1089
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:18,580
to the minus iHt over h
bar on the state, which

1090
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:27,970
is e to the alpha a dagger minus
alpha star a e to the output

1091
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:37,090
and into the iHt over h bar,
and an e to the minus iHt over h

1092
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:38,640
bar on the vacuum.

1093
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,420
So I put the one here.

1094
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:42,830
I evolve with this.

1095
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:47,210
But I take the state
and put this and that.

1096
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:49,265
This is simple.

1097
01:23:49,265 --> 01:23:54,980
It's e to the minus
iH omega over 2.

1098
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:56,980
That's the energy
of the ground state.

1099
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,850
But what is this part?

1100
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:11,080
It's pretty much the
Heisenberg operator.

1101
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,020
But the sign came out wrong.

1102
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,530
Well, it didn't come out wrong.

1103
01:24:18,530 --> 01:24:21,250
It's what it is.

1104
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:24,290
It just means that
what I have to put here

1105
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:29,000
is the Heisenberg
operator at minus t.

1106
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,250
Because I have t for minus t.

1107
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:36,010
So this is e to the
alpha a Heisenberg at

1108
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:40,536
minus t dagger minus alpha star.

1109
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,910
I'm sorry, I have too
many parentheses here.

1110
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:52,880
That's it, much
better-- minus alpha

1111
01:24:52,880 --> 01:25:00,050
star a Heisenberg of minus
t acting on this thing.

1112
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:01,400
And what is this?

1113
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,800
Well, we have the formula for
the Heisenberg states here.

1114
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:11,840
So you've got e to the
alpha H a dagger of minus t

1115
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:20,390
would be e to the minus
I omega t a dagger.

1116
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:23,950
And here, you have
minus alpha star e

1117
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:30,210
to the i omega t a
on e to the minus

1118
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:35,110
i omega h bar over
2 times the vacuum.

1119
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:36,430
And look what has happened.

1120
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:44,860
Alpha has become alpha times
e to the minus i omega t.

1121
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:47,200
Because the star is here.

1122
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:50,200
It's minus the star one.

1123
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,460
So the only thing
that has changed

1124
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:57,590
is that this state,
alpha at time t,

1125
01:25:57,590 --> 01:26:03,590
is e to the minus
ih bar omega over 2.

1126
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:05,290
I'm sorry, I'm missing a t here.

1127
01:26:07,810 --> 01:26:09,160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1128
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:18,800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I dropped--
yeah, minus i omega t over 2,

1129
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:29,370
minus i omega t over 2,
minus i omega t over 2,

1130
01:26:29,370 --> 01:26:35,880
times the coherent state, the
time independent coherent state

1131
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:40,090
of value e to the
minus i omega t alpha.

1132
01:26:40,090 --> 01:26:41,745
That's a new complex number.

1133
01:26:45,390 --> 01:26:48,290
That's what has happened.

1134
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:51,940
The number alpha has become
e to the minus i omega t.

1135
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:55,410
Now, this is a face for the
whole state multiplicative.

1136
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:56,900
It's irrelevant.

1137
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:59,040
So what has this alpha done?

1138
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:03,390
It has been rotated by e
to the minus i omega t.

1139
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:09,880
So this at the time t
is the state alpha t.

1140
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:11,220
Here is the state alpha.

1141
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:15,500
And it has rotated by omega t.

1142
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:18,650
So the coherent state
can be visualized

1143
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:22,870
as a complex number
in this complex plane.

1144
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:26,110
This real part is the
expectation value of x at time

1145
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:28,760
equals 0 whose imaginary
part is the expectation

1146
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:31,720
value of the momentum
at time equals 0.

1147
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,700
And how does it evolve?

1148
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:37,480
This state just rotates
with frequency omega

1149
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:40,510
all along and forever.

1150
01:27:40,510 --> 01:27:43,120
All right, that's it for today.

1151
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,670
See you on Wednesday.

1152
01:27:44,670 --> 01:27:46,470
[APPLAUSE]

1153
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:48,431
PROFESSOR: Thank you, thank you.
