8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,130
PROFESSOR: Going to
get started right away.

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:29,570
I want to make a comment
about energy time uncertainty

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,460
relations.

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,530
And we talked last
time about the fact

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,260
that the energy time uncertainty
relation really tells you

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,760
something about how
fast a state can change.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,580
So an interesting way
to try to evaluate

15
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,950
that is to consider
a system that

16
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,950
has to state that time
equals 0 and compute

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,550
the overlap with a
state at time equals t.

18
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:06,880
Now this overlap is a
very schematic thing.

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,210
It's a bracket.

20
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,710
It's a number.

21
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,960
And you know what that means.

22
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,240
You can keep in
mind what that is.

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,780
It's an integral over space
possibly of psi star at t

24
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:29,600
equals 0 x psi t x.

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,820
It's a complete integral,
its inner product.

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:39,650
So you may want to understand
this, because, in a sense,

27
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:44,310
this is telling you how
quickly a state can change.

28
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,820
At time equals 0, this
overlap is just 1.

29
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,020
A little later, this
overlap is going to change

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,880
and perhaps after some time
the overlap is going to be 0.

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,120
And we're going to say that we
actually have changed a lot.

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,300
So this number is very
interesting to compute.

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,530
And in fact, we might
as well square it,

34
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,740
because it's a complex number.

35
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,760
So to understand better
what it is we'll square it.

36
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,340
And we'll have to evaluate this.

37
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,310
Now how could you evaluate this?

38
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,670
Well, we'll assume that this
system that governs this time

39
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,425
evolution has a time
independent Hamiltonian.

40
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,630
Once this evolution is done by
a time independent Hamiltonian,

41
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,120
you can wonder what it is.

42
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,640
Now it's quite
interesting, and you

43
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,660
will have to discuss
that in the homework

44
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,190
because it will
actually help you

45
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,810
prove that version of the
time energy uncertainty

46
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,650
relationship that says that the
quickest time state can turn

47
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,490
orthogonal to itself is
bounded by some amount.

48
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,880
Cannot do it infinitely fast.

49
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,250
So you want to know how
fast this can change.

50
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:22,010
Now it's very surprising what
it depends on, this thing.

51
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:28,740
Because suppose you had
an energy eigenstate,

52
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,070
suppose psi at time equals
0 is an energy eigenstate.

53
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,740
What would happen later on?

54
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,160
Well, you know that
energy eigenstates

55
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,560
evolve with a phase,
an exponential of e

56
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,820
to the minus iht over h bar.

57
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:51,320
So actually if you had
an energy eigenstate,

58
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,235
this thing would remain
equal to 1 for all times.

59
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,770
So if this is going
to be non-zero,

60
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,375
it's because it's
going to have--

61
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,360
you have to have a state is
not an energy eigenstate.

62
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,720
That you're going to have
an uncertainty in the energy

63
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,340
and energy uncertainty.

64
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,745
So the curious thing is that you
can evaluate this, and expand

65
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:23,735
it as a power in t, and go,
say, to quadratic ordering

66
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:26,456
in t evaluating what this is.

67
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:30,670
And this only depends
on the uncertainty of h,

68
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,840
and t, and things like that.

69
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,450
So only the uncertainty of
h matters at this moment.

70
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,700
So this would be quite
interested, I think,

71
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,690
for you to figure out
and to explore in detail.

72
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,650
That kind of analysis
has been the center

73
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:56,150
of attention recently, having
to do with quantum computation.

74
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,700
Because in a sense,
in a quantum computer,

75
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,640
you want to change states
quickly and do operations.

76
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,270
So how quickly you can
change a state is crucial.

77
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,970
So in fact, the people that
proved these inequalities

78
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,760
that you're going to find
say that this eventually

79
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,110
will limit the speed
of a quantum computer,

80
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:25,440
and more slow that computers
become twice as fast every year

81
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,210
or so, and double the speed.

82
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,440
So this limit
apparently, it's claimed,

83
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,870
will allow 80
duplications of the speed

84
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:43,430
until you hit this limit
in a quantum computer

85
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,760
due to quantum mechanics.

86
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:52,940
So you will be investigating
this in next week's homework.

87
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,460
Today we want to begin
quickly with an application

88
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,980
of the uncertainty principal to
find exact bounds of energies

89
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,830
for quantum systems, for ground
states of quantum systems.

90
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,340
So this will be a very precise
application of the uncertainty

91
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,970
principle.

92
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,150
Then we'll turn to a
completion of these things

93
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,310
that we've been
talking about having

94
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,830
to do with linear algebra.

95
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:24,350
We'll get to the main
theorems of the subject.

96
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,070
In a sense, the most important
theorems of the subject.

97
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,240
These are the spectral
theorem that tells you

98
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,140
about what operators
can be diagonalized.

99
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,520
And then a theorem that
leads to the concept

100
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,610
of a complete set of
commuting observables.

101
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,030
So really pretty key
mathematical ideas.

102
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:51,500
And the way we're good to
do it, I think you will see,

103
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,080
that we have gained a lot by
learning the linear algebra

104
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,270
concepts in a
slightly abstract way.

105
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,390
I do remember doing this
proof that we're going today

106
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,060
in previous years,
and it was always

107
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,310
considered the most complicated
lecture of the course.

108
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,830
Just taking the
[? indices ?] went crazy,

109
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,540
and lots of formulas, and
the notation was funny.

110
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,620
And now we will do
the proof, and we'll

111
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,170
write a few little things.

112
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,810
And we'll just try to
imagine what's going on.

113
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,150
And will be, I think, easier.

114
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,460
I hope you will agree.

115
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,036
So let's begin with an example
of a use of the uncertainty

116
00:07:35,036 --> 00:07:35,535
principle.

117
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:38,800
So example.

118
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,980
So this will be
maybe for 20 minutes.

119
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:48,220
Consider this Hamiltonian for
a one dimensional particle

120
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,240
that, in fact, you've
considered before,

121
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,510
alpha x to the fourth, for which
you did some approximations.

122
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,290
You know that the
expectation value

123
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,460
of the energy in
the ground state.

124
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,220
You've done it numerically.

125
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,950
You've done it variationally.

126
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,710
And variationally you knew
that the energy at every stage

127
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,940
was smaller at a given bound.

128
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,570
The uncertainty
principle is not going

129
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,780
to give us an upper bound.

130
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,390
It's going to give
us a lower bound.

131
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,540
So it's a really
nice thing, because

132
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,610
between the variational
principal and the uncertainty

133
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,039
principle, we can narrow the
energy of this ground state

134
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,210
to a window.

135
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,140
In one of the problems that
you're doing for this week--

136
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,460
and I'm sorry only
today you really

137
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,590
have all the tools after you
hear this discussion-- you

138
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,505
do the same for the
harmonic oscillator.

139
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:54,740
You do a variational estimate
for the ground state energy.

140
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,420
You do the uncertainty principle
bound for ground state energy.

141
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,820
And you will see
these two bounds meet.

142
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,320
And therefore after you've
done this to bounds,

143
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,480
you found the
ground state energy

144
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,100
of the harmonic oscillator,
so it's kind of a neat thing.

145
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,570
So we want to estimate
the ground state energy.

146
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,930
So we first write some words.

147
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,180
We just say H in
the ground state

148
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,060
will be given by the
expectation value of p squared

149
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,290
in the ground state plus
alpha times the expectation

150
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:35,210
value of x to the fourth
in the ground state.

151
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,850
Haven't made much
progress, but you

152
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,310
have, because you're starting to
talk about the right variables.

153
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,920
Now this thing to
that you have to know

154
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,950
is that you have
a potential that

155
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,530
is like this, sort
of a little flatter

156
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,900
than x squared potential.

157
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,280
And what can we say about
the expectation value

158
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,420
of the momentum on
the ground state

159
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,380
and the expectation value
of x in the ground state?

160
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,530
Well, the expectation value
of x should be no big problem.

161
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,940
This is a symmetric
potential, therefore

162
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,990
wave functions in a one
dimensional quantum mechanics

163
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,180
problems are either
symmetric or anti symmetric.

164
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,430
It could not be anti
symmetric because it's

165
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,790
a ground state and
kind of have a 0.

166
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,620
So it's asymmetric.

167
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,180
Has no nodes.

168
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,800
So there's the wave
function of the ground

169
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,850
state, the symmetric,
and the expectation value

170
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,580
of x in the ground state is 0.

171
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,930
Similarly, the expectation value
of the momentum in the ground

172
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,275
state, what is it?

173
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:49,775
Is?

174
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,120
0 too.

175
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,740
And you can imagine
just computing it.

176
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,030
It would be the integral of psi.

177
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:08,190
Psi is going to be a real
d dx h bar over i psi.

178
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,830
This is a total derivative.

179
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,810
If it's a bound state,
it's 0 at the ends.

180
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,645
This is 0.

181
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,280
So actually, we have a
little advantage here.

182
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:29,530
We have some control
over what p squared is,

183
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:39,630
because the uncertainty in p
in the ground state-- well,

184
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:45,670
the uncertainty in p squared
is the expectation value

185
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:51,490
of p squared minus the
expectation value of p squared.

186
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:57,120
So in the ground
state, this is 0.

187
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,990
So delta p squared
in the ground state

188
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,010
is just p squared
on the ground state.

189
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,570
Similarly, because
the expectation value

190
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:16,730
of x is equal to 0, delta x
squared in the ground state

191
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:23,130
is equal to expectation value of
x squared in the ground state.

192
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,950
So actually, this expectation
of p squared is delta p.

193
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,950
And we want to use the
uncertainty principle,

194
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,670
so that's progress.

195
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,266
We've related something we want
to estimate to an uncertainty.

196
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,600
Small complication is that
we have an expectation

197
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,850
value of x to the fourth.

198
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:53,540
Now we learned-- maybe
I can continue here.

199
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,510
We learned that the expectations
value for an operator squared

200
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,060
is bigger than or equal
to the expectation

201
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,300
value of the operator squared.

202
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:10,300
So the expectation
value of x to the fourth

203
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:16,930
is definitely bigger than the
expectation value of x squared

204
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,590
squared.

205
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,270
And this is true on any state.

206
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,900
This was derived when
we did uncertainty.

207
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,530
We proved that the
uncertainty squared

208
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,150
is positive, because
the norm of a vector,

209
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,820
and that gave you this thing.

210
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,340
So here you think of the
operator as x squared.

211
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,050
So the operator squared
is x to the fourth.

212
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,630
And here's the operator
expectation value squared.

213
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,120
So this is true for
the ground state.

214
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,070
It's also here true for any
state, so is the ground state.

215
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,580
And this x squared
now is delta x.

216
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:05,120
So this is delta x on the
ground state to the fourth.

217
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,425
So look what we have.

218
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:12,460
We have that the expectation
value of H on the ground state

219
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:17,890
is strictly equal to delta p
on the ground state squared

220
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:23,120
over 2m plus alpha.

221
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,660
And we cannot do a Priorean
equality here, so we have this.

222
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,700
This is so far an equality.

223
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:37,320
But because of this, this
thing is bigger than that.

224
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,850
Well, alpha is supposed
to be positive.

225
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:46,990
So this is bigger than delta
p ground state squared over

226
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:53,555
2m plus alpha delta x on the
ground state to the fourth.

227
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,040
OK, so far so good.

228
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,850
We have a strict thing, this.

229
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,270
And the order of the inequality
is already showing up.

230
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,830
We're going to get, if
anything, a lower bound.

231
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,575
You're going to be bigger
than or equal to something.

232
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,610
So what is next?

233
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,000
Next is the
uncertainty principle.

234
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,780
We know that delta p delta
x is greater than or equal

235
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,540
to h bar over 2 in any state.

236
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:36,090
So the delta p ground state
and delta x on the ground state

237
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,260
still should be equal to that.

238
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:43,660
Therefore delta p ground
state is bigger than

239
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:51,170
or equal than h over 2 delta x
in the ground state like that.

240
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,480
So this inequality still
the right direction.

241
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:05,140
So we can replace
this by something

242
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,050
that is bigger than
this quantity day

243
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,620
without disturbing the logic.

244
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,800
So we have H ground
state now is greater

245
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,490
than or equal to replace
the delta p by this thing

246
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:27,860
here, h squared over 8,
because this is squared

247
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:37,230
and there's another 2m delta x
ground state squared plus alpha

248
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:42,060
delta x ground
state to the fourth.

249
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,010
And that's it.

250
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,970
We've obtained this inequality.

251
00:16:52,340 --> 00:17:00,830
So here you say, well, this
is good but how can I use it?

252
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,270
I don't know what delta
x is in the ground state,

253
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,099
so what have I gained?

254
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:11,540
Well, let me do
a way of thinking

255
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,290
about this that can help you.

256
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:21,599
Plot the right hand side
as a function of delta

257
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,380
x on the ground.

258
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,270
So you don't know
how much it is,

259
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,840
delta x on the ground
state, so just plot it.

260
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,400
So if you plot this
function, there

261
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,910
will be a divergence as
this delta x goes to 0,

262
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,250
then it will be a minimum.

263
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,420
It will be a positive minimum,
because this is all positive.

264
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,125
And then it will go up again.

265
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,100
So the right hand side as a
function of delta x is this.

266
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,950
So here it comes.

267
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,490
You see I don't know
what delta x is.

268
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,640
Suppose delta x
happens to be this.

269
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,760
Well, then I know
that the ground state

270
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,460
energy is bigger
than that value.

271
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,070
But maybe that's not delta x.

272
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:14,280
Delta x may be is this
on the ground state.

273
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,280
And then if it's that, well,
the ground state energy

274
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,830
is bigger than this
value over here.

275
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,570
Well, since I just
don't know what it is,

276
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,570
the worst situation
is if delta x is here,

277
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:38,150
and therefore definitely H must
be bigger than the lowest value

278
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,130
that this can take.

279
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:47,000
So the claim is that
H of gs, therefore

280
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,070
is greater than or equal than
the minimum of this function

281
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,620
h squared over 8m, and
I'll just write here

282
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:06,900
delta x squared plus alpha delta
x to the fourth over delta x.

283
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,995
The minimum of this function
over that space is the bound.

284
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:22,770
So I just have to do a
calculus problem here.

285
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,760
This is the minimum.

286
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,260
I should take the derivative
with respect to delta x.

287
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,060
Find delta x and substitute.

288
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,140
Of course, I'm not
going to do that here,

289
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,170
but I'll tell you a formula
that will do that for you.

290
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:43,800
A over x squared
plus Bx to the fourth

291
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:50,660
is minimized for x squared
is equal to 1 over 2--

292
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,250
it's pretty awful numbers.

293
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:58,550
2 to the 1/3 A
over B to the 1/3.

294
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:12,390
And its value at that point is
2 to the 1/3 times 3/2 times

295
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,760
A to the 2/3 times B to the 1/3.

296
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,335
A little bit of arithmetic.

297
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,210
So for this function,
it turns out

298
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,390
that A is whatever
coefficient is here.

299
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,280
B is whatever
coefficient is there,

300
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,130
so this is supposed
to be the answer.

301
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:46,130
And you get H on
the ground state

302
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:52,830
is greater than or equal to
2 to the 1/3 3/8 h squared

303
00:20:52,830 --> 00:21:02,430
square root of alpha over m to
the 2/3, which is about 0.4724

304
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:09,030
times h squared square root
of alpha over m to the 2/3.

305
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,410
And that's our bound.

306
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,740
How good or how
bad is the bound?

307
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,540
It's OK.

308
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,190
It's not fabulous.

309
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:30,710
The real answer is done
numerically is 0.668.

310
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,580
I think I remember
variational principal gave you

311
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,170
something like 0.68 or 0.69.

312
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:43,790
And this one says
it's bigger than 0.47.

313
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,190
It gives you something.

314
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:50,700
So the important thing is
that it's completely rigorous.

315
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,310
Many times people use
the uncertainty principle

316
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,190
to estimate ground
state energies.

317
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,560
Those estimates
are very hand wavy.

318
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,800
You might as well just
do dimensional analysis.

319
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,570
You don't gain anything.

320
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,500
You don't know the factors.

321
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,185
But this is completely rigorous.

322
00:22:08,185 --> 00:22:12,240
I never made an approximation
or anything here.

323
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,160
Every step was logical.

324
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,580
Every inequality was exact.

325
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,250
And therefore, this
is a solid result.

326
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,980
This is definitely true.

327
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,970
It doesn't tell you an
estimate of the answer.

328
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:31,400
If you dimensional analysis, you
say the answer is this times 1,

329
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,350
and that's as good as you can
do with dimensional analysis.

330
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,530
It's not that bad.

331
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:41,480
The answer turns out to be 0.7.

332
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,110
But the uncertainty
principle really,

333
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,660
if you're careful, sometimes,
not for every problem,

334
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:52,190
you can do a rigorous thing
and find the rigorous answer.

335
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,400
OK, so are there any questions?

336
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,980
Your problem in
the homework will

337
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,900
be to do this for the
harmonic oscillator

338
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,911
and find the two bounds.

339
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:07,410
Yes?

340
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,910
AUDIENCE: How does
the answer change

341
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,492
if we don't look at
the ground state?

342
00:23:10,492 --> 00:23:11,900
PROFESSOR: How do they what?

343
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,890
PROFESSOR: How does
the answer change

344
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,320
if we look at a state different
from the ground state?

345
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,190
PROFESSOR: Different
from the ground state?

346
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,970
So the question was
how would this change

347
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,650
if I would try to do something
different from the ground

348
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,720
state.

349
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,640
I think for any
state, you would still

350
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,470
be able to say that
the expectation

351
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,700
value of the momentum is 0.

352
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,430
Now the expectation value
of x still would be 0.

353
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:48,460
So you can go through
some steps here.

354
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,760
The problem here being
that I don't have a way

355
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,260
to treat any other
state differently.

356
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,690
So I would go ahead,
and I would have

357
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:03,830
said for any stationary state,
or for any energy eigenstate,

358
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,660
all of what I said is true.

359
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,110
So I don't get a new one.

360
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,140
These things people actually
keep working and writing papers

361
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,880
on this stuff.

362
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,810
People sometimes find bounds
that are a little original.

363
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,124
Yes?

364
00:24:23,124 --> 00:24:25,415
AUDIENCE: How do you know
the momentum expectation is 0

365
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:25,914
again?

366
00:24:25,914 --> 00:24:30,170
PROFESSOR: The momentum
expectation for a bound state

367
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:30,940
goes like this.

368
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,379
So you want to figure
out what is psi p psi.

369
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:36,420
And you do the following.

370
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,350
That's integral.

371
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,230
Now psi in these
problems can be chosen

372
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,710
to be real, so I won't bother.

373
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:52,240
It's psi of x h bar
over i d dx of psi.

374
00:24:52,240 --> 00:25:01,525
So this is equal to h bar over
2i the integral dx of d dx

375
00:25:01,525 --> 00:25:02,765
of psi squared.

376
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:13,960
So at this moment, you say
well that's just h bar over 2i,

377
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,800
the value of psi squared at
infinity and at minus infinity.

378
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,360
And since it's a bound
state, it's 0 here, 0 there,

379
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,020
and it's equal to 0.

380
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,800
A state that would have
expectation value of momentum

381
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,520
you would expect
it to be moving.

382
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,610
So this state is
there is static.

383
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,630
It's stationary It doesn't have
expectation value of momentum.

384
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,250
Yes?

385
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,172
AUDIENCE: Is the reason that
you can't get a better estimate

386
00:25:45,172 --> 00:25:47,607
for the things that are
on the ground state,

387
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:50,042
because if you consider
the harmonic oscillator,

388
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:53,451
the uncertainty delta x
[? delta p ?] from the ground

389
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:57,370
state [INAUDIBLE] you
go up to higher states.

390
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,770
PROFESSOR: Right, I
think that's another way.

391
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:05,580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] higher
state using the absolute.

392
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,920
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

393
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,150
That's a [INAUDIBLE].

394
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,920
So the ground state of the
harmonic oscillator saturates

395
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,280
the uncertainty principal
and the others don't.

396
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,630
So this argument, I think,
is just good for ground state

397
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,750
energies.

398
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,902
One more question.

399
00:26:23,902 --> 00:26:26,510
AUDIENCE: It appears that
this method really works.

400
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,638
Doesn't particularly work well
if we have a potential that

401
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:32,932
has an odd power, because we
can't use [? the packet ?],

402
00:26:32,932 --> 00:26:35,430
like x [INAUDIBLE] expectation
value x to the fourth

403
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,670
is something, some
power, expectation.

404
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,820
PROFESSOR: Right, if
it's an odd power,

405
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,450
the method doesn't work well.

406
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,000
But actually for an
odd power, the physics

407
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,010
doesn't work well either,
because the system doesn't

408
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,410
have ground states.

409
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:56,020
And so let's say
that if you had x

410
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,470
to the fourth plus some x
cubed, the physics could still

411
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,740
make sense.

412
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,590
But then it's not clear
I can do the same.

413
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,080
Actually you can
do the same for x

414
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,570
to the eighth and any sort
of powers of this type.

415
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,470
But I don't think it
works for x to the sixth.

416
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,780
You can try a few things.

417
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:19,390
OK, so we leave the
uncertainty principle

418
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:28,480
and begin to understand
more formerly the operators

419
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,120
for which there's no uncertainty
and you can simultaneously

420
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,860
diagonalize them.

421
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,150
So we're going to find
operators like A and B,

422
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,050
that they commute.

423
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,070
And then sometimes
you can simultaneously

424
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:43,810
diagonalize them.

425
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:44,310
Yes?

426
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,645
You have a question.

427
00:27:45,645 --> 00:27:50,082
AUDIENCE: So part of [INAUDIBLE]
we use here is [INAUDIBLE],

428
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:50,582
right?

429
00:27:50,582 --> 00:27:51,290
PROFESSOR: Right.

430
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:59,031
AUDIENCE: If we get an asset--
is there any way that we

431
00:27:59,031 --> 00:28:03,272
can better our [INAUDIBLE]
principle based on the wave

432
00:28:03,272 --> 00:28:05,008
function with non saturated?

433
00:28:05,008 --> 00:28:07,988
Can we get an upper
bound for just

434
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:10,521
[INAUDIBLE] principle
with an h bar over it?

435
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:12,020
PROFESSOR: Can I
get an upper bound?

436
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,260
I'm not sure I
understand your question.

437
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,966
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the fact
that the [INAUDIBLE] principle

438
00:28:18,966 --> 00:28:20,250
will not be saturated.

439
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:26,542
Can you put the bound for
just taking [INAUDIBLE]?

440
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,070
PROFESSOR: Yeah, certainly.

441
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,460
You might have some
systems in which

442
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,270
you know that this
uncertainty might

443
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,730
be bigger than the one warranted
by the uncertainty principles.

444
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,620
And you use that information.

445
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,420
But on general grounds,
it's hard to know

446
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,730
that a system might come
very close to satisfy

447
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,120
the uncertainty principle
in its ground state.

448
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,050
We don't know.

449
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,220
There are systems that come
very close in the ground state

450
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,800
to satisfy this and
some that are far.

451
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,790
If they are far, you
must have some reason

452
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,710
to understand that to use it.

453
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,320
So I don't know.

454
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,080
So let me turn now to
this issue of operators

455
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:25,156
and diagonalization
of operators.

456
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:36,350
Now you might be irritated
a little even by the title.

457
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,800
Diagonalization of operation.

458
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:42,970
You'll be talking about
diagonalization of matrices.

459
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,160
Well, there's a
way to state what

460
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,660
we mean by diagonalizing
an operator in such a way

461
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,990
that we can talk later
about the matrix.

462
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,670
So what is the point here?

463
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,360
You have an operator,
and it's presumably

464
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,090
an important operator
in your theory.

465
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:09,250
You want to understand
this operator better.

466
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,280
So you really are
faced with a dilemma.

467
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,480
How do I get some insight
into this operator?

468
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,610
Perhaps the simplest thing
you could do is to say,

469
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:26,530
OK let me choose some ideal
basis of the vector space,

470
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,370
such as that operator
is as simple as possible

471
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,530
in that basis.

472
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,870
So that's the origin
of this thing.

473
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:37,090
Find a basis in the state
space, so the operator

474
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,310
looks as simple as possible.

475
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:43,800
So you say that you can
diagonalize an operator

476
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:51,950
if you can find the basis
such that the operator has

477
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,300
just diagonal entries.

478
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,770
So let me just
write it like this.

479
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:20,990
So if you can find a basis in
V where the matrix representing

480
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:34,950
the operator is
diagonal, the operator

481
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:39,150
is said to be diagonalizable.

482
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,870
So to be diagonalizable
is just a statement

483
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:54,370
that there is some basis
where you look at the matrix

484
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,410
representation
operator, and you find

485
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:59,300
that it takes form
as a diagonal.

486
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:04,770
So let's try to understand
this conceptually

487
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,220
and see what actually
it's telling us.

488
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,440
It tells us actually a lot.

489
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:24,590
Suppose t is diagonal in
some basis u1 up to un.

490
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,460
So what does it mean
for it to be diagonal?

491
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,790
Well, you may remember
all these definitions

492
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,580
we had about matrix action.

493
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:42,700
If T acting on a ui
is supposed to be

494
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:49,970
Tki uk in some basis sum over k.

495
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,070
You act on ui, and
you get a lot of u's.

496
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:57,610
And these are the matrix
elements of the operator.

497
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:01,150
Now the fact that
it's diagonalizable

498
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:05,010
means that in some basis, the
u basis, this is diagonal.

499
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:10,465
So ki in this sum only
happens to work out

500
00:33:10,465 --> 00:33:12,640
when k is equal to i.

501
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,440
And that's one number and you
get back to the vector ui.

502
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,860
So if it's diagonal
in this basis,

503
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:28,060
you have the T on u1 is lambda
a number times u1 T on u2

504
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,140
is lambda 2 in u2.

505
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,883
And Tun equal lambda n un.

506
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,740
So what you learn is
that this basis vector--

507
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,010
so you learn something
that maybe you

508
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,910
thought it's tautological.

509
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,350
It's not tautological.

510
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:53,210
You learn that if you have
a set of basis vectors

511
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:56,140
in which the
operator is diagonal,

512
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:02,450
these basis vectors are
eigenvectors of the operator.

513
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:06,510
And then you learn something
that is quite important,

514
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:12,100
that an operator is
diagonalizable if,

515
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,179
and only if, it has
a set of eigenvectors

516
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,230
that span the space.

517
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,830
So the statement
is very important.

518
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:29,830
An operator T is
that diagonalizable

519
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:43,717
if it has a set of eigenvectors
that span the space.

520
00:34:43,717 --> 00:34:50,980
Span V. If and only if.

521
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,210
If this double f.

522
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:56,770
If and only if.

523
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:00,490
So here it's diagonalizable,
and we have a basis,

524
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:03,720
and it has a set of
these are eigenvectors.

525
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,000
So diagonalizable
realizable really

526
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,560
means that it has a
set of eigenvectors

527
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,370
that span the space.

528
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,590
On the other hand, if you have
the set of eigenvectors that

529
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:19,520
span the space, you have a
set of u's that satisfy this,

530
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,250
and then you read that, oh
yeah, this matrix is diagonal,

531
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,220
so it's diagonalizable.

532
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,050
So a simple statement,
but an important one,

533
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:35,600
because there are examples of
matrices that immediately you

534
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,330
know you're never going
to succeed to diagonalize.

535
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:42,648
So here is one matrix, 0 0 1 0.

536
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:50,450
This matrix has
eigenvalues, so you

537
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:54,560
do the characteristic equation
lambda squared equals 0.

538
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,790
So the only eigenvalue
is lambda equals 0.

539
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,350
And let's see how
many eigenvectors

540
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:04,050
you would have for
lambda equals 0.

541
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:09,320
Well, you would have if
this is T, T on some vector

542
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,560
a b must be equal to 0.

543
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:25,750
So this is 0 1 0 0 on a b,
which is b and 0, must be zero.

544
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,990
So b is equal to 0.

545
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:33,090
So the only
eigenvector here-- I'll

546
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,190
just write it here and then
move to the other side.

547
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,770
The only eigenvector
for lambda equals 0,

548
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:41,510
the only eigenvector
is with b equals 0.

549
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,610
So it's 1 0.

550
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,610
One eigenvector only.

551
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,620
No more eigenvectors.

552
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,780
By the theorem,
or by this claim,

553
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,305
you know it's a two dimensional
vector space you just

554
00:36:55,305 --> 00:36:57,310
can't diagonalize this matrix.

555
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,560
It's impossible.

556
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,700
Can't be done.

557
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,760
OK, a couple more
things that I wish to

558
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,550
say about this process
of diagonalization.

559
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,820
Well, the statement that
an operator is diagonal

560
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:23,370
is a statement about the
existence of some basis.

561
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:26,820
Now you can try to figure
out what that basis is,

562
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,950
so typically what is the
problem that you face?

563
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:35,264
Typically you have a
vector spaces V. Sorry?

564
00:37:35,264 --> 00:37:36,430
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

565
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,055
PROFESSOR: Yes?

566
00:37:39,555 --> 00:37:43,190
If you had an infinite
dimensional space

567
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:49,340
and you had an operator
whose eigenvectors do not

568
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:53,175
span the space, can it
still have eigenvectors,

569
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:56,090
or does it not have any then?

570
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:56,860
PROFESSOR: No.

571
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,930
You said it has
some eigenvectors,

572
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,394
but they don't span the space.

573
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:01,810
So it does have
some eigenvectors.

574
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,899
AUDIENCE: So my question
is was what I just

575
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:08,060
said a logical contradiction in
an infinite dimensional space?

576
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,450
PROFESSOR: To have
just some eigenvectors?

577
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:10,950
I think--

578
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,680
PROFESSOR: I'm looking
more specifically

579
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,825
at a dagger for instance.

580
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:15,450
PROFESSOR: Yes.

581
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,160
AUDIENCE: In the
harmonic oscillator,

582
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,660
you I think mentioned at some
point that it does not have--

583
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,980
PROFESSOR: So the
fact that you can'

584
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,060
diagonalize this
thing already implies

585
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,450
that it's even worse
in higher dimensions.

586
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:32,720
So some operator
may be pretty nice,

587
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,370
and you might still be
able to diagonalize it,

588
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:39,154
so you're going to lack
eigenvectors in general.

589
00:38:39,154 --> 00:38:40,570
You're going to
lack lots of them.

590
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,730
And there are going to
be blocks of Jordan.

591
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:46,420
Blocks are called things that
are above the diagonal, things

592
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,750
that you can't do much about.

593
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:56,530
Let me then think concretely now
that you have a vector space,

594
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:03,380
and you've chosen
some basis v1 vn.

595
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:08,920
And then you look
at this operator T,

596
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,540
and of course, you chose
an arbitrary basis.

597
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,000
There's no reason why
its matrix representation

598
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,210
would be diagonal.

599
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:23,540
So T on the basis v-- Tij.

600
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,440
Sometimes to be very explicit
we write Tij like that--

601
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,700
is not diagonal.

602
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,310
Now if it's not
diagonal, the question

603
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:38,390
is whether you can find a
basis where it is diagonal.

604
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:42,050
And then you try, of
course, changing basis.

605
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,090
And you change basis--
you've discussed

606
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,710
that in the homework--
with a linear operator.

607
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,800
So you use a linear
operator to produce

608
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,490
another basis, an
invertible in your operator.

609
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:58,670
So that you get these vectors
uk being equal to some operator

610
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,280
A times vk.

611
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,560
So this is going to be
the u1's up to un's are

612
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,690
going to be another basis.

613
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:12,350
The n vector here
is the operator

614
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:15,680
acting with the n
vector on this thing.

615
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,340
And then you prove, in the
homework, a relationship

616
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:27,010
between these matrix elements
of T in the new basis,

617
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,310
in the u basis.

618
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,500
And the matrix elements
of T in the v basis.

619
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:42,650
You have a
relationship like this,

620
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:50,720
or you have more explicitly
Tij in the basis u

621
00:40:50,720 --> 00:41:03,602
is equal to A minus
1 ik Tkp of v Apj.

622
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,955
So this is what happens.

623
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,550
This is the new
operator in this basis.

624
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,020
And typically what
you're trying to do

625
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:24,020
is find this matrix A
that makes this thing

626
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,090
into a diagonal matrix.

627
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:30,020
Because we say in the u basis
the operator is diagonal.

628
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,740
I want to emphasize that there's
a couple of ways in which you

629
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,230
can think of diagonalization.

630
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,490
Sort of a passive
and an active way.

631
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:51,050
You can imagine the
operator, and you

632
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,610
say look, this
operator I just need

633
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:58,860
to find some basis in
which it is diagonal.

634
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:02,280
So I'm looking for a basis.

635
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,070
The other way of
thinking of this operator

636
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:17,940
is to think that A minus
1 TA is another operator,

637
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,930
and it's diagonal
in original basis.

638
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:29,020
So it might have seem funny
to you, but let's stop again

639
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,170
and say this again.

640
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:34,620
You have an operator, and the
question of diagonalization

641
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:39,540
is whether there is some basis
in which it looks diagonal,

642
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,060
its matrix is diagonal.

643
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,650
But the equivalent
question is whether there

644
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:48,690
is an operator A
such that this is

645
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:52,800
diagonal in the original basis.

646
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,680
To make sure that you see
that, consider the following.

647
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,170
So this is diagonal
in the original basis.

648
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:16,240
So in order to see that, think
of Tui is equal to lambda i ui.

649
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,010
We know that the
u's are supposed

650
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:23,350
to be this basis of eigenvectors
where the matrix is diagonal,

651
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,210
so here you got it.

652
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,200
Here the i not summed.

653
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,820
It's pretty important.

654
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,300
There's a problem with
this eigenvalue notation.

655
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,580
I don't know how
to do it better.

656
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,340
If you have several eigenvalues,
you want to write this,

657
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:44,950
but you don't want this to
think that you're acting on u1

658
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,910
and you get lambda 1 u1.

659
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,320
Not the sum right here.

660
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:55,640
OK, but they ui is
equal to A on vi.

661
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:05,560
So therefore this
is lambda i A on vi.

662
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,080
And then you'll
act with A minus 1.

663
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:16,000
Act with A minus 1 from
the left with the operator.

664
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:25,610
So you get A minus 1 TA vi
is equal to lambda i vi.

665
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,090
So what do you see?

666
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:33,270
You see an operator
that is actually

667
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:37,130
diagonal in the v basis.

668
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:41,730
So this operator is diagonal
in the original basis.

669
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,950
That's another way of
thinking of the process

670
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,160
of diagonalization.

671
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:53,700
There's one last remark,
which is that the columns of A

672
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,770
are the eigenvectors, in fact.

673
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:02,343
Columns of A are
the eigenvectors.

674
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,670
Well, how do you see that?

675
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:11,700
It's really very simple.

676
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,030
You can convince
yourself in many ways,

677
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:19,760
but the uk are the eigenvectors.

678
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,480
But what are uk's?

679
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,470
I have it somewhere.

680
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,290
There it is.

681
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:25,510
A on vk.

682
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,740
And A on vk is this
matrix representation

683
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:45,528
is sum over i Aik vi.

684
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,320
So now if this is
the original basis,

685
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,560
the vi's are your
original basis,

686
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:04,240
then you have the
following, that the vi's

687
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,530
can be thought as the basis
vectors and represented

688
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:16,740
by columns with a
1 in the ith entry.

689
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:24,590
So this equation is saying
nothing more, or nothing less

690
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:32,300
than uk, in terms of
matrices or columns,

691
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:49,230
is equal to A1k v1 plus Ank
vn, which is just A1k A2k Ank.

692
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:56,590
Because vi is the
ith basis vector.

693
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:01,680
So 1 0's only in
the ith position.

694
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:12,860
So these are the eigenvectors.

695
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,070
And they're thought as linear
combinations of the vi's.

696
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:19,180
The vi's are the
original basis vectors.

697
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:23,950
So the eigenvectors
are these numbers.

698
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:33,130
OK, we've talked
about diagonlization,

699
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:38,890
but then there's a term that is
more crucial for our operators

700
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,870
that we're interested in.

701
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:43,170
We're talking about
Hermitian operators.

702
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:46,420
So the term that is going
to be important for us

703
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:53,020
is unitarily diagonalizable.

704
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:04,180
What is a unitarily
diagonalizable operator?

705
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,800
Two ways again of
thinking about this.

706
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,950
And perhaps the first
way is the best.

707
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:13,030
And I will say it.

708
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:19,740
A matrix is set to be
unitarily diagonalizable

709
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:24,720
if you have an orthonormal
basis of eigenvectors.

710
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:34,390
Remember diagonalizable meant
a basis of eigenvectors.

711
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:35,470
That's all it means.

712
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:40,420
Unitarily diagonalizable
means orthonormal basis

713
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,190
of eigenvectors.

714
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:53,845
So T has an orthonormal
basis of eigenvectors.

715
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:03,826
Now that's a very
clear statement.

716
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,870
And it's a fabulous
thing if you can achieve,

717
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:14,820
because you basically
have broken down the space

718
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:20,270
into basis spaces, each one
of them with a simple thing

719
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:21,420
before your operators.

720
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,860
And they're orthonormal,
so it's the simplest

721
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,510
possible calculational tool.

722
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:29,710
So it's ideal if
you can have this.

723
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:33,730
Now the way we think
of this is that you

724
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:36,370
start with--
concretely, you start

725
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:42,735
with a T of some basis v
that is an orthonormal basis.

726
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:52,700
Start with an orthonormal
basis, and then

727
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:57,940
pass to another
orthonormal basis u.

728
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:01,110
So you're going to pass to
another orthonormal basis

729
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:04,390
u with some operator.

730
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:06,570
But what you have
learned is that if you

731
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:12,600
want to pass from v
orthonormal to another basis

732
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:17,040
u, a vector that is
also orthonormal,

733
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,330
the way to go from
one to the other

734
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:21,520
is through a unitary operator.

735
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,560
Only unitary operators pass you
from orthonormal to orthonormal

736
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,530
basis.

737
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:31,860
Therefore really, when
you start with your matrix

738
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:35,320
in an orthonormal basis
that is not diagonal,

739
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:41,600
the only thing you can
hope is that T of u

740
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:52,900
will be equal to sum u dagger,
or u minus 1, T of v u.

741
00:50:52,900 --> 00:51:02,500
Remember, for a unitary
operator, where u is unitary,

742
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,420
the inverse is the dagger.

743
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,040
So you're doing a
unitary transformation,

744
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:12,580
and you find the matrix that
is presumably then diagonal.

745
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:16,720
So basically, unitarily
diagonalizable

746
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,390
is the statement
that if you start

747
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:23,820
with the operator in an
arbitrary orthonormal basis,

748
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,840
then there's some unitary
operator that takes you

749
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,080
to the privilege basis in which
your operator is diagonal,

750
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,900
is still orthonormal.

751
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:39,430
But maybe in a more simple
way, unitarily diagonalizable

752
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,830
is just a statement
that you can find

753
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:46,050
an orthonormal basis
of eigenvectors.

754
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:52,010
Now the main theorem
of this subject,

755
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:54,110
perhaps one of the
most important theorems

756
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:57,540
of linear algebra, is
the characterization

757
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:02,020
of which operators have such
a wonderful representation.

758
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,870
What is the most
general operator T

759
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:14,320
that will have an orthonormal
basis of eigenvectors?

760
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:20,390
Now we probably have heard that
Hermitian operators do the job.

761
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,720
Hermitian operators have that.

762
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,830
But that's not the
most general ones.

763
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:29,280
And given that you want
the complete result,

764
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,400
let's give you the
complete result.

765
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,740
The operators that have
this wonderful properties

766
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,030
are called normal
operators, and they

767
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,930
satisfy the following property.

768
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:56,400
M is normal if M dagger, the
adjoint of it, commutes with M.

769
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,520
So Hermitian
operators are normal,

770
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:04,750
because M dagger is equal
to M, and they commute.

771
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:07,940
Anti Hermitian mission
operators are also normal,

772
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:10,360
because anti Hermitian
means that dagger

773
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:14,920
is equal to minus M, and
it still commutes with M.

774
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:21,180
Unitary operators have
U dagger U equal to U U

775
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,260
dagger equals to 1.

776
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:27,750
So U and U dagger
actually commute as well.

777
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:32,370
So Hermitian, anti
Hermitian, unitary, they're

778
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:33,706
all normal operators.

779
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:39,590
What do we know about
normal operators?

780
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:45,390
There's one important result
about normal operators,

781
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,060
a lemma.

782
00:53:48,970 --> 00:54:07,970
If M is normal and
W is an eigenvector,

783
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:17,110
such that MW is
equal to lambda W.

784
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:22,090
Now normal operators need
not have real eigenvalues,

785
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:25,200
because they include
unitary operators.

786
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:32,042
So here I should write
Hermitian, anti Hermitian,

787
00:54:32,042 --> 00:54:35,715
and unitary are normal.

788
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:45,460
So here is what a normal
operator is doing.

789
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,810
You have a normal operator.

790
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:49,760
It has an eigenvector
with some eigenvalue.

791
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,640
Lambda is a complex
number in principle.

792
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,190
Then the following
result is true,

793
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:06,300
then M dagger omega is also
an eigenvector of M dagger.

794
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,920
And it has eigenvalue
lambda star.

795
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,830
Now this is not all
that easy to show.

796
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:23,320
It's a few lines, and
it's done in the notes.

797
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,170
I ask you to see.

798
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:25,585
It's actually very elegant.

799
00:55:28,702 --> 00:55:31,740
What is the usual
strategy to prove things

800
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:37,210
like that Is to say oh, I want
to show this is equal to that,

801
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:40,540
so I want to show that
this binds that is 0.

802
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,760
So I have a vector
that is zero what

803
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,400
is the easiest way
to show that it's 0?

804
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,780
If I can show it's norm is 0.

805
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,900
So that's a typical
strategy that you

806
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,350
use to prove equalities.

807
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:56,430
You say, oh, it's a vector
that must be 0 as my equality.

808
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:57,740
Let's see if it's 0.

809
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,130
Let's find its norm,
and you get it.

810
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:02,280
So that's a result.

811
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:11,695
So with this stated, we
finally have the main result

812
00:56:11,695 --> 00:56:13,740
that we wanted to get to.

813
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:20,660
And I will be very
sketchy on this.

814
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,200
The notes are complete,
but I will be sketchy here.

815
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,005
It's called the
spectral theorem.

816
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:48,105
Let M be an operator in
a complex vector space.

817
00:56:55,820 --> 00:57:12,420
The vector space has
an orthonormal basis

818
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:31,780
of eigenvectors of M if
and only if M is normal.

819
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:37,370
So the normal operators are it.

820
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:43,270
You want to have a complete set
of orthonormal eigenvectors.

821
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:46,900
Well, this will only
happen if your operator

822
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:50,580
is normal, end of story.

823
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:59,200
Now there's two things
about this theorem

824
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:06,650
is to show that if it's
diagonalizable, it is normal,

825
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:11,110
and the other thing is to
show, that if it's normal,

826
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:12,780
it can be diagonalized.

827
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:17,270
Of course, you can
imagine the second one

828
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:19,620
is harder than the first.

829
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:23,050
Let me do the first
one for a few minutes.

830
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:28,010
And then say a couple of
words about the second.

831
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:31,660
And you may discuss
this in recitation.

832
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:35,150
It's a little
mathematical, but it's all

833
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:37,350
within the kind of
things that we do.

834
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:40,970
And really it's fairly
physical in a sense.

835
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:43,860
We're accustomed to do
such kinds of arguments.

836
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:54,270
So suppose it's
unitarily diagonalizable,

837
00:58:54,270 --> 00:59:02,880
which means that M-- so
if you have U dagger,

838
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:09,490
MU is equal to a
diagonal matrix, DM.

839
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:11,140
I'm talking now matrices.

840
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:14,550
So these are all matrices,
a diagonal matrix.

841
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:23,130
There's no basis to the
notion of a diagonal operator,

842
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:26,380
because if you have
a diagonal operator,

843
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,120
it may not look diagonal
in another basis.

844
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:34,570
Only the identity operator is
diagonal in all basis, but not

845
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,330
the typical diagonal operator.

846
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:40,440
So unitarily
diagonalizable, as we said,

847
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,850
you make it-- it's
gone somewhere.

848
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:44,540
Here.

849
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,900
You act with an
inverse matrices,

850
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,640
and you get the diagonal matrix.

851
00:59:48,640 --> 01:00:01,190
So from this, you find that
M is equal to U DM U dagger

852
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:05,610
by acting with U on the left and
with U dagger from the right,

853
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:09,830
you solve for M, and it's this.

854
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:15,670
And then M dagger is the
dagger of these things.

855
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:22,100
So it's U to DM dagger U dagger.

856
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:26,490
The U's sort of
remain the same way,

857
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:30,100
but the diagonal matrix
is not necessarily real,

858
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:34,200
so you must put the
dagger in there.

859
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:40,540
And now M dagger M. To check
that the matrix is normal

860
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,360
that commutator should be 0.

861
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:46,380
So M dagger M. You
do this times that.

862
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:51,030
You get U DM dagger.

863
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:53,790
U dagger U. That's one.

864
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:57,416
DM U dagger.

865
01:00:57,416 --> 01:01:02,110
And M M dagger you multiply
the other direction

866
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:08,640
you get U DM DM dagger U dagger.

867
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:22,750
So the commutator of M dagger
M is equal to U DM dagger DM

868
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:29,880
minus DM Dm dagger U dagger.

869
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:34,290
But any two diagonal
matrices commute.

870
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,430
They may not be that simple.

871
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:38,970
Diagonal matrices are not
the identity matrices,

872
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:40,770
but for sure they commute.

873
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:45,570
You multiply elements along
with diagonal so this is 0.

874
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:53,260
So certainly any unitarily
diagonalizable matrix

875
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:54,970
is normal.

876
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:56,910
Now the other part
of the proof, which

877
01:01:56,910 --> 01:02:03,170
I'm not going to speak about,
it's actually quite simple.

878
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:08,440
And it's based on the fact that
any matrix in a complex vector

879
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,500
space has at least
one eigenvalue.

880
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:16,610
So what you do is you pick
out that eigenvalue and it's

881
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:19,110
eigenvector, and
change the basis

882
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:22,510
to use that eigenvector
instead of your other vectors.

883
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:24,730
And then you look at the matrix.

884
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:27,012
And after you use
that eigenvector,

885
01:02:27,012 --> 01:02:31,490
the matrix has a lot of 0's
here and a lot of 0's here.

886
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:35,920
And then the matrix has been
reduced in dimension mansion,

887
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,130
and then you go step by step.

888
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:41,590
So basically, it's the
fact that any operator

889
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:45,190
has at least one eigenvalue
and at least one eigenvector.

890
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:47,150
It allows you to go down.

891
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:55,530
And normality is analogous
to Hermiticity in some sense.

892
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:59,130
And the statement that
you have an eigenvector

893
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:03,800
generally tells you that this
thing is full of 0's, but then

894
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,170
you don't know that
there are 0's here.

895
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:09,990
And either normality
or Hermiticity

896
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,830
shows that there are
0's here, and then you

897
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:13,490
can proceed at lower dimensions.

898
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:16,580
So you should look at
the proof because it

899
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:22,160
will make clear to you that
you understand what's going on.

900
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:26,480
OK but let's take it for granted
now you have these operators

901
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:32,750
and can be diagonalized.

902
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:37,787
Then we have the
next thing, which

903
01:03:37,787 --> 01:03:39,120
is simultaneous diagonalization.

904
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:45,550
What is simultaneous
diagonalization?

905
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:47,670
It's an awfully important thing.

906
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:51,690
So we will now focus on
simultaneous diagonalization

907
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:53,380
of Hermitian operators.

908
01:03:53,380 --> 01:04:02,150
So simultaneous diagonalization
of Hermitian ops.

909
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:11,990
Now as we will emphasize
towards the end,

910
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:16,250
this is perhaps one of
the most important ideas

911
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:18,210
in quantum mechanics.

912
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:22,540
It's this stuff that allows
you to label and understand

913
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,240
your state system.

914
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,000
Basically you need
to diagonalize

915
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,340
more than one operator
most of the time.

916
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,340
You can say OK, you found
the energy eigenstates.

917
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,930
You're done.

918
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:37,270
But if you find your
energy eigenstates

919
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:39,980
and you think you're
done, maybe you

920
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:44,250
are if you have all these
energy eigenstates tabulated.

921
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,390
But if you have
a degeneracy, you

922
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:51,640
have a lot of states that
have the same energy.

923
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,241
And what's different about them?

924
01:04:53,241 --> 01:04:54,990
They're certainly
different because you've

925
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:57,770
got several states, but
what's different about them?

926
01:04:57,770 --> 01:05:00,600
You may not know,
unless you figure out

927
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,010
that they have different
physical properties.

928
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:07,250
If they're different, something
must be different about them.

929
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:09,550
So you need more
than one operator,

930
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:13,220
and your facing the problem of
simultaneously diagonalizing

931
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:17,500
things, because states cannot
be characterized just by one

932
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,440
property, one observable.

933
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:24,160
Would be simple if you could,
but life is not that simple.

934
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,520
So you need more
than one observable,

935
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:31,250
and then you ask
when can they be

936
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:34,090
simultaneously diagonalizable.

937
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:35,710
Well, the statement is clear.

938
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:40,720
If you have two
operators, S and T that

939
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:46,050
belong to the linear
operators in a vector space,

940
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:49,650
they can be simultaneously
diagonalized

941
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:58,330
if there is a basis for
which every basis vector is

942
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:02,210
eigenstate of this and
an eigenstate of that.

943
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:04,420
Common set of eigenstates.

944
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:07,330
So they can be
simultaneously diagonalized.

945
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:12,920
Diagonalizable is that there
is a basis where this basis is

946
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:16,410
comprised of the
eigenvectors of the operator.

947
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:19,760
So this time you require
more, that that basis

948
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,690
be at the same time a basis
set of eigenvectors of this

949
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:28,320
and a set of eigenvectors
of the second one.

950
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:36,450
So a necessary condition for
simultaneous diagonalization

951
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,570
is that they commute.

952
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:40,760
Why is that?

953
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:44,240
The fact that two operators
commute or they don't commute

954
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,130
is an issue that is
basis independent.

955
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:51,010
If they don't commute,
the order gives something

956
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:54,730
different, and that you
can see in every basis.

957
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:59,850
So if they don't commute
and they're simultaneously

958
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:04,680
diagonalizable, there would
be a basis in which both

959
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,300
are diagonal and they
still wouldn't commute.

960
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,960
But you know that
diagonal matrices commute.

961
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,890
So if two operators
don't commute,

962
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:15,130
they must not
commute in any base,

963
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:18,260
therefore there can't
be a basis in which both

964
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:21,350
are at the same time diagonal.

965
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:25,500
So you need, for
simultaneous diagonalizable,

966
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,420
you need that S and P commute.

967
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:34,660
Now that may not be enough,
because not all operators

968
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:35,820
can be diagonalized.

969
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:38,900
So the fact that they commute
is necessary, but not everything

970
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,560
can be diagonalizable.

971
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,530
Well, you've learned that
every normal operator,

972
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:47,800
every Hermitian operator
is diagonalizable.

973
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:51,820
And then you got now
a claim of something

974
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:54,160
that could possibly be true.

975
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:58,590
Is the fact that whenever you
have two Hermitian operators,

976
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:01,330
each one can be
diagonalized by themselves.

977
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:03,230
And they commute.

978
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:08,030
There is a simultaneous
set of eigenvectors of 1

979
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:11,040
that are eigenvectors of
the first and eigenvectors

980
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,240
of the second.

981
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:25,710
So the statement is that
if S and T are commuting

982
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:34,990
Hermitian operators, they can
be simultaneously diagonalized.

983
01:08:49,569 --> 01:08:57,420
So this theorem would
be quite easy to show

984
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,294
if there would be
no degeneracies,

985
01:08:59,294 --> 01:09:01,680
and that's what we're
going to do first.

986
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,510
But then we'll consider
the case of degeneracies.

987
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:13,100
So I'm going to consider
the following possibilities.

988
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:16,700
Perhaps neither one has
a degenerate spectrum.

989
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,790
What does it mean a
degenerate spectrum?

990
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:22,229
Same eigenvalue
repeated many times.

991
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:26,120
But that is a wishful
thinking situation.

992
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,960
So either both are
non degenerate,

993
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,890
either one is non degenerate
and the other is degenerate,

994
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:35,939
or both are degenerate.

995
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:40,130
And that causes a very
interesting complication.

996
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:43,439
So let's say there's
going to be two cases.

997
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:44,670
It will suffice.

998
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:46,630
In fact, it seems
that there are three,

999
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:49,510
but two is enough to consider.

1000
01:09:49,510 --> 01:10:01,020
There is no degeneracy
in T. So suppose

1001
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:05,600
one operator has no
degeneracy, and let's call

1002
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,990
it T. So that's one possibility.

1003
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:12,300
And then S may be degenerate,
or it may not be degenerate.

1004
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:19,500
And the second possibility
is that both S and T

1005
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,125
are degenerate.

1006
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:30,150
So I'll take care
of case one first.

1007
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:33,530
And then we'll discuss
case two, and that

1008
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:36,730
will complete our discussion.

1009
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:42,380
So suppose there's
no the degeneracy

1010
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:46,860
in the spectrum
of T. So case one.

1011
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:52,200
So what does that mean?

1012
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:56,290
It means that T
is non degenerate.

1013
01:10:56,290 --> 01:11:00,280
There's a basis U1
can be diagonalized

1014
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:10,690
to UM, orthonormal by
the spectral theorem.

1015
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:15,170
And there's eigenvectors T
U-- these are eigenvectors.

1016
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,480
Lambda I Ui.

1017
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:22,010
And lambda I is
different to lambda j

1018
01:11:22,010 --> 01:11:25,606
for i different from j.

1019
01:11:25,606 --> 01:11:30,540
So all the eigenvalues,
again, it's not summed here.

1020
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:36,300
All the eigenvalues
are different.

1021
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,640
So what do we have?

1022
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:42,490
Well, each of
those eigenvectors,

1023
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:46,630
each of the Ui's that
are eigenvectors,

1024
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:49,905
generate invariant subspaces.

1025
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:52,570
There are T invariant subspaces.

1026
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:57,580
So each one, each
vector U1 you can

1027
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:00,020
imagine multiplying by
all possible numbers,

1028
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,330
positive and negative.

1029
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:04,910
And that's an invariant
one dimensional subspace,

1030
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:08,700
because if you act with T,
it's a T invariant space,

1031
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:12,760
you get the number
times a vector there.

1032
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:15,930
So the question that
you must ask now

1033
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:20,770
is you want to know if these
are simultaneous eigenvectors.

1034
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:26,350
So you want to figure
out what about S.

1035
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:30,010
How does S work with this thing?

1036
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:34,640
So you can act with
S from the left.

1037
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:43,340
So you get STUi is
equal to lambda i SUi.

1038
01:12:47,081 --> 01:12:57,960
So here each Ui generates
an invariant subspace Ui T

1039
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:58,460
invariant.

1040
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:13,796
But S and T commute, so you have
T SUi is equal to lambda i SUi.

1041
01:13:13,796 --> 01:13:16,170
And look at that equation again.

1042
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:20,160
This says that
this vector belongs

1043
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:31,370
to the invariant subspace Ui,
because it satisfies exactly

1044
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:36,610
the property that T acting on
it is equal to lambda i Ui.

1045
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:40,560
And it couldn't belong to
any other of the subspaces,

1046
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,700
because all the
eigenvalues are different.

1047
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:53,180
So spaces that are in Ui are the
spaces-- vectors that are in Ui

1048
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:56,700
are precisely all those
vectors that are left invariant

1049
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:59,800
by the action of T.
They're scaled only.

1050
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:03,590
So this vector is also in Ui.

1051
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:07,480
If this vector is
in Ui, SUi must

1052
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:12,640
be some number Wi times Ui.

1053
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:18,940
And therefore you've shown that
Ui is also an eigenvector of S,

1054
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:22,836
possibly with a different
eigenvalue of course.

1055
01:14:22,836 --> 01:14:24,335
Because the only
thing that you know

1056
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:26,340
is that SUi is in this space.

1057
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:29,250
You don't know how big it is.

1058
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:34,850
So then you've shown
that, indeed, these Ui's

1059
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:45,280
that were eigenstates of T
are also eigenstates of S.

1060
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,910
And therefore
that's the statement

1061
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:51,290
of simultaneously
diagonalizable.

1062
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:55,340
They have the common
set of eigenvectors.

1063
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:58,770
So that's this part.

1064
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:04,020
And it's relatively
straight forward.

1065
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:07,380
Now we have to do case two.

1066
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:09,280
Case two is the interesting one.

1067
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:16,240
This time you're going
to have degeneracy.

1068
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:19,410
We have to have a notation
that is good for degeneracy.

1069
01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:28,610
So if S is degeneracies,
has degeneracies,

1070
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:31,820
what happens with this operator?

1071
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:38,050
It will have-- remember,
a degenerate operator

1072
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:43,440
has eigenstates that form higher
than one dimensional spaces.

1073
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,840
If you have different
eigenvalues,

1074
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:52,360
each one generates a one
dimensional operator invariant

1075
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:53,670
subspace.

1076
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:55,480
But if you have
degeneracies, there

1077
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,960
are operators-- there are
spaces of higher dimensions that

1078
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,330
are left invariant.

1079
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:09,330
So for example, let Uk
denote the S invariant

1080
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:16,680
subspace of some
dimension Dk, which

1081
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,790
is greater or equal than 1.

1082
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:29,160
I will go here first.

1083
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:39,380
We're going to define Uk to
be the set of all vectors

1084
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:51,510
so that SU is equal
to lambda k U.

1085
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:59,150
And this will have dimension
of Uk is going to be Dk.

1086
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:01,570
So look what's happening.

1087
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:05,240
Basically the fact is
that for some eigenvalues,

1088
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:09,870
say the kth eigenvalue, you
just get several eigenvectors.

1089
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:13,510
So if you get several
eigenvectors not just scaled

1090
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:15,690
off each other,
these eigenvectors

1091
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:19,200
correspond to that
eigenvalue span of space.

1092
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,750
It's a degenerate subspace.

1093
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:25,140
So you must imagine
that as having

1094
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:29,280
a subspace of some
dimensionality with some basis

1095
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:32,840
vectors that span this thing.

1096
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:35,460
And they all have
the same eigenvector.

1097
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:38,940
Now you should really
have visualized

1098
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:40,800
this in a simple way.

1099
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,520
You have this subspace like a
cone or something like that,

1100
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:50,250
in which every vector
is an eigenvector.

1101
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:54,410
So every vector, when it's
acted by S is just scaled up.

1102
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:57,720
And all of them are
scaled by the same amount.

1103
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:01,320
That is what this
statement says.

1104
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:12,310
And corresponding to this thing,
you have a basis of vectors,

1105
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:14,790
of these eigenvectors,
and we'll call

1106
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:28,700
them Uk1, the first one,
the second, up to U Dk1,

1107
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:31,280
because it's a
subspace that we say

1108
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:35,270
it has the dimensionality Dk.

1109
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:37,540
So look at this thing.

1110
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:39,240
Somebody tells you
there's an operator.

1111
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,810
It has degenerate spectrum.

1112
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:46,120
You should start imagining all
kind of invariant subspaces

1113
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,540
of some dimensionality.

1114
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:51,970
If it has degeneracy, it's
a degeneracy each time

1115
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:54,870
the Dk is greater than
1, because if it's

1116
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:58,740
one dimensional, it's
just one basis vector one

1117
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:01,250
eigenvector, end of the story.

1118
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:04,250
Now this thing, by
the spectral theorem,

1119
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:06,490
this is an orthonormal basis.

1120
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:10,010
There's no problem, when you
have a degenerate subspace,

1121
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:11,810
to find an orthonormal basis.

1122
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:17,080
The theorem guarantees it,
so these are all orthonormal.

1123
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:20,300
So at the end of the day,
you have a decomposition

1124
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:28,470
of the vector space, V as U1
plus U2 plus maybe up to UM.

1125
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:36,330
And all of these vector
spaces like U's here, they

1126
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:39,340
may have some with just
no degeneracy, and some

1127
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:42,990
with degeneracy 2,
degeneracy 3, degeneracy 4.

1128
01:19:42,990 --> 01:19:44,700
I don't know how
much degeneracy,

1129
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:48,420
but they might have
different degeneracy.

1130
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:53,350
Now what do we say next?

1131
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:58,870
Well, the fact that S
is a Hermitian operator

1132
01:19:58,870 --> 01:20:01,210
says it just can
be diagonalized,

1133
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:03,550
and we're can find
all these spaces,

1134
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:06,020
and the basis for
the whole thing.

1135
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:15,110
So the basis would look U1
of the first base up to U d1

1136
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:17,430
of the first base.

1137
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:19,659
These are the basis
vectors of the first

1138
01:20:19,659 --> 01:20:21,200
plus the basis
vectors of the second.

1139
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:28,155
All the basis vectors U1
up to Udm of the mth space.

1140
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,970
All this is the list.

1141
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:43,650
This is the basis
of V. So I've listed

1142
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:48,130
the basis of V, which a basis
for U1, all these vectors.

1143
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:50,540
U2, all of this.

1144
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:52,720
So you see, we're not
calculating anything.

1145
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,740
We're just trying to
understand the picture.

1146
01:20:55,740 --> 01:21:03,940
And why is this operator,
S, diagonal in this basis?

1147
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:04,720
It's clear.

1148
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:11,940
Because every vector here, every
vector is an eigenvector of S.

1149
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:14,940
So when you act with
S on any vector,

1150
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:17,270
you get that vector
times a number.

1151
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:20,190
But that vector is
orthogonal to all the rest.

1152
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:25,270
So when you have some
U and S and another U,

1153
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:29,430
this gives you a vector
proportional to U.

1154
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:31,030
And this is another vector.

1155
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:34,900
The matrix element is 0,
because they're all orthogonal.

1156
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:39,190
So it should be obvious why
this list produces something

1157
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:43,130
that is completely
orthogonal-- a diagonal matrix.

1158
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:48,890
So S, in this basis, looks
like the diagonal matrix

1159
01:21:48,890 --> 01:22:04,700
in which you have lambda 1 d1
times up to lambda m dm times.

1160
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:11,900
Now I'll have to go until
2:00 to get the punchline.

1161
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:15,340
I apologize, but we
can't stop right now.

1162
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:21,010
We're almost there,
believe it or not.

1163
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:22,705
Two more things.

1164
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:33,890
This basis is good, but
actually another basis

1165
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:35,570
would also be good.

1166
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:41,450
I'll write this other basis
would be a V1 acting on the U1

1167
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:50,960
up to V1 acting on that U1 up to
a Vm acting on this U1 up to Vm

1168
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,040
acting on that U1.

1169
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,240
This is m.

1170
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:55,920
m.

1171
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,420
This is dm.

1172
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:00,210
And here it's not U1.

1173
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:00,830
It's Ud1.

1174
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:08,660
You see, in the first
collection of vectors,

1175
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:15,420
I act with an operator V1 up
to here with an operator Vm.

1176
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:33,730
All of them with Vk being
a unitary operator in Uk.

1177
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:38,660
In every subspace, there
are unitary operators.

1178
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:41,930
So you can have
these bases and act

1179
01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:46,140
with a unitary operator
of the space U1 here.

1180
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:48,350
A unitary operator
with a space U2 here.

1181
01:23:48,350 --> 01:23:52,980
A unitary operator
of the space Un here.

1182
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:55,720
Hope you're following.

1183
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:59,230
And what happens if this
operator is unitary,

1184
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:02,320
this is still an
orthonormal basis in U1.

1185
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:07,680
These are still
orthonormal basis in Um.

1186
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:10,870
And therefore this is
an orthonormal basis

1187
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:14,810
for the whole thing, because
anyway those different spaces

1188
01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:17,320
are orthogonal to each other.

1189
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,270
It's an orthogonal
decomposition.

1190
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:21,700
Everything is orthogonal
to everything.

1191
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:26,817
So this basis would be equally
good to represent the operator.

1192
01:24:26,817 --> 01:24:27,316
Yes?

1193
01:24:27,316 --> 01:24:31,150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
arbitrary unitary operators?

1194
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:34,710
PROFESSOR: Arbitrary unitary
operators at this moment.

1195
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:37,170
Arbitrary.

1196
01:24:37,170 --> 01:24:42,300
So here comes the catch
as to the main property

1197
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:53,220
that now you want to establish
is that the spaces Uk are also

1198
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:54,043
T invariant.

1199
01:24:56,990 --> 01:24:59,870
You see, the spaces
Uk were defined

1200
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:03,370
to be S invariant subspaces.

1201
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:07,950
And now the main important
thing is that they are also T

1202
01:25:07,950 --> 01:25:12,660
invariant because they
commute with that.

1203
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:15,310
So let's see why
that is the case.

1204
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:18,950
Suppose U belongs to Uk.

1205
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:26,970
And then let's look at the
vector-- examine the vector Tu.

1206
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:29,270
What happens to Tu?

1207
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:35,740
Well, you want to act on
S on Tu to understand it.

1208
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:40,880
But S and T commute,
so this is T SU.

1209
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,260
But since U belongs
to Uk, that's

1210
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:46,890
the space with
eigenvalue lambda k.

1211
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:55,110
So this is lambda k times
u, so you have Tu here.

1212
01:25:55,110 --> 01:26:00,260
So Tu acted with S
gives you lambda k Tu.

1213
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:05,785
So Tu is in the
invariant subspace Uk.

1214
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:20,570
What's happening here is now
something very straightforward.

1215
01:26:20,570 --> 01:26:29,680
You try to imagine how does
the matrix T look in the basis

1216
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,660
that we have here.

1217
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:34,240
Here is this basis.

1218
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:38,340
how does this matrix T look?

1219
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:46,910
Well, this matrix keeps
the invariant subspaces.

1220
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:50,070
So you have to think of
it blocked diagonally.

1221
01:26:53,850 --> 01:26:56,990
If it acts on it-- here
are the first vectors

1222
01:26:56,990 --> 01:26:59,100
that you're considering, the U1.

1223
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:03,190
Well if you act on it
with T of the U1 subspace,

1224
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:05,140
you stay in the U1 subspace.

1225
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:06,580
So you don't get anything else.

1226
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:09,490
So you must have
0's all over here.

1227
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:12,320
And you can have a matrix here.

1228
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:17,720
And if you act on the second
Uk U2, you get a vector in U2,

1229
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:20,150
so it's orthogonal to
all the other vectors.

1230
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:22,330
So you get a matrix here.

1231
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:24,070
And you get a matrix here.

1232
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:30,150
So actually you get a
blocked diagonal matrix

1233
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:35,350
in which the blocks
correspond to the degeneracy.

1234
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:41,540
So if there's a degeneracy
d1 here, it's a d1 times d1.

1235
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:45,690
And d2 times d2.

1236
01:27:45,690 --> 01:27:48,710
So actually you
haven't simultaneously

1237
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:50,300
diagonalized them.

1238
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:52,160
That's the problem
of degeneracy.

1239
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:55,560
You haven't, but you
now have the tools,

1240
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:59,020
because this operator is
Hermitian, therefore it's

1241
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:03,060
Hermitian here, and
here, and here, and here.

1242
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:05,840
So you can diagonalize here.

1243
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,880
But what do you need
for diagonalizing here?

1244
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,950
You need a unitary matrix.

1245
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:13,400
Call it V1.

1246
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:16,140
For here you need
another unitary matrix.

1247
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:18,430
Call it V2.

1248
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:19,910
Vn.

1249
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:24,140
And then this matrix
becomes diagonal.

1250
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:26,990
But then what about
the old matrix?

1251
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:31,400
Well, we just explained here
that if you change the basis

1252
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:37,330
by unitary matrices, you
don't change the first matrix.

1253
01:28:37,330 --> 01:28:39,900
So actually you succeeded.

1254
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:45,030
You now can diagonalize
this without destroying

1255
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:46,130
your earlier result.

1256
01:28:46,130 --> 01:28:49,430
And you managed to
diagonalize the whole thing.

1257
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:52,180
So this is for two
operators in the notes.

1258
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:56,060
You'll see why it simply extends
for three, four, and five,

1259
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:58,410
or arbitrary number
of operators.

1260
01:28:58,410 --> 01:29:00,860
See you next time.
