8
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:27,260
PROFESSOR: OK so we're going to
do this thing of the hydrogen

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,350
atom and the algebraic solution.

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:38,930
And I think it's
not that long stuff

11
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,140
so we can take it
easy as we go along.

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,480
I want to remind you of a couple
of facts that will play a role.

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,290
One result that is very general
about the addition of angular

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,850
momentum that you
should of course know

15
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:02,530
is that if you
have a j1 times j2.

16
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,500
What does this mean?

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:15,650
You have some states of--
first angular momentum J1

18
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,270
that so you have a
whole multiplet with J1

19
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,060
equals little j1.

20
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:28,260
Which means the states in that
multiplet have J1 squared,

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,160
giving you h squared.

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,370
Little j1 times
little j1 plus 1.

23
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,430
That's having a j1 multiplet.

24
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,050
You have a j2 multiplet.

25
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,160
And these are two independent
commuting angular momenta

26
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,440
acting on different
degrees of freedom

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,020
of the same particle
or different particles.

28
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,210
And what you've
learned is that this

29
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,570
can be written as a
sum of representations.

30
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,580
As a direct sum of
angular momenta,

31
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:17,114
which goes from j1 plus
j2 plus j1 plus j2 minus 1

32
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:25,490
all the way up to
the representation

33
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,390
with j1 minus j2.

34
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,750
And these are all
representations or multiplets

35
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,070
that live in the
tense or product,

36
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:42,625
but they are multiplets
of J equals j1 plus j2.

37
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,140
These states here
can be reorganized

38
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,970
into these
multiplets, and that's

39
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,120
our main result for the
addition of angular momentum.

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,435
Mathematically, this
formula summarizes it all.

41
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,390
These states, when
you write them

42
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,520
as a basis here-- you
take a basis state here

43
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,540
times a basis state here-- these
are called the coupled bases.

44
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,990
And then you reorganize,
you form linear combinations

45
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,220
that you have been
playing with, and then

46
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,500
they get reorganized
into these states.

47
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,610
So these are called
the coupled bases

48
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,720
in which we're
talking about states

49
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,660
of the sum of angular momentum.

50
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,500
So that's one fact
we've learned about.

51
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,810
Now as far as
hydrogen is concerned,

52
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,490
we're going to try today
to understand the spectrum.

53
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,830
And for that let me remind
you what the spectrum was.

54
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:58,750
The way we organized it was
with an L versus energy levels.

55
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,770
And we would put an L equals
0 state here-- well maybe--

56
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,259
there's color, so
why not using color.

57
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,175
Let's see if it works.

58
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,100
Yeah, it's OK.

59
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,050
L equals 0.

60
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,280
And this was called n equals 1.

61
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:31,020
There's an n equals 2 that
has an L equals 0 state

62
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,915
and an L equals 1 state.

63
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,650
There's an n equals 3
state, set of states

64
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,800
that come within L equals 0 and
L equals 1 and an L equals 2.

65
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,980
And it just goes on and on.

66
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:02,910
With the energy levels En
equals minus e squared over 2a0.

67
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:09,250
That combination is familiar
for energy, Bohr radius, charge

68
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,470
of electron, with
a 1 over n squared.

69
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:21,280
And the fact is that for
any level, for each n,

70
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,625
L goes from 0, 1,
2, up to n minus 1.

71
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:39,785
And for each n there's a
total of n squared states.

72
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:50,310
And you see it here, you have
n equals 2, n equals 1, one

73
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,930
state.

74
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,660
n equals 2, you have
L equals 0, one state.

75
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,530
L equals 1 is 3 states.

76
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,480
So it's 4.

77
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,080
Here we'll have 4 plus 5.

78
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,960
So 9.

79
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,990
And maybe you can do
it, it's a famous thing,

80
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,470
there's n squared
states at every level.

81
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,990
So this pattern that
of course continues

82
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,380
and-- it's a little
difficult to do

83
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,150
a nice diagram of the
hydrogen atom in scale

84
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,050
because it's all pushed
towards the zero energy

85
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,520
with 1 over n squared,
but that's how it goes.

86
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,165
For n equals 4, you have
1, 2, 3, 4 for example.

87
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,383
And this is what we
want to understand.

88
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:53,060
So in order to do that, let's
return to this Hamiltonian,

89
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:59,690
which is p squared over
2m minus e squared over r.

90
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,486
And to the Runge-Lenz vector
that we talked about in lecture

91
00:07:04,486 --> 00:07:07,340
and you've been playing with.

92
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:13,170
So this Runge-Lenz
vector, r, is defined

93
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:26,830
to be 1 over 2me squared p
cross L minus L cross p minus r

94
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,470
over r.

95
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,860
And it has no units.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,290
It's a vector that
you've learned

97
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,150
has interpretation of
a constant vector that

98
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,520
points in this direction, r.

99
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,010
And it just stays fixed
wherever the particle is going.

100
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,570
Classically this is
a constant vector

101
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,820
that points in the direction of
the major axis of the ellipse.

102
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,080
With respect to this vector,
this vector is Hermitian.

103
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,320
And you may recall that when
we did the classical vector,

104
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:16,660
you had just p cross
L and no 2 here.

105
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,550
There are now two terms here.

106
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,040
And they are necessary because
we want to have a Hermitian

107
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,790
operator, and this
is the simplest

108
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,790
way to construct the
Hermitian operator, r.

109
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:35,510
And the way is that you
add to this this term,

110
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,580
that if L and p commuted as
they do in classical mechanics,

111
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,240
that the term is
identical to this.

112
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,530
And you get back to
the conventional thing

113
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,920
that you had in
classical mechanics.

114
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,130
But in quantum mechanics, of
course, they don't commute,

115
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,110
so it's a little bit different.

116
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,580
And moreover this
thing, r, is Hermitian.

117
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,780
L and p are Hermitian but
when you take the Hermitian

118
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:08,110
conjugate, L goes to
the other side of p.

119
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,050
And since they don't commute,
that's not the same thing.

120
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,100
So actually the Hermitian
conjugate of this term is this.

121
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,100
There's an extra minus
sign in hermiticity

122
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,500
when you have a cross product.

123
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
So this is the Hermitian
conjugate of this,

124
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,120
this is the Hermitian
conjugate of this second term,

125
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,300
here's the first and
therefore this is actually

126
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,010
a Hermitian operator.

127
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,120
And you can work with it.

128
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,480
Moreover, in the case
of classical mechanics,

129
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,190
it was conserved.

130
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,240
In the case of quantum
mechanics this statement

131
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,350
of conservation
quantum mechanics

132
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:53,610
is something that in one of the
exercises that you were asked

133
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,460
to try to do this computation
so these computations

134
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,490
are challenging.

135
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,280
They're not all that trivial
and are good exercises.

136
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,670
So this is one of them.

137
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,400
This is practice.

138
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,940
OK this is the vector r.

139
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,140
What about it?

140
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,900
A few more things about
it that are interesting.

141
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,840
Because of the
hermiticity condition

142
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,840
or in-- a way you can
check this directly

143
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,710
in fact was one of the
exercises for you to do,

144
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,770
was p cross L-- you
did it long time ago,

145
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:50,320
I think-- is equal to minus
L cross b plus 2ih bar p.

146
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:53,666
This is an identity.

147
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:12,100
And this identity helps
you write this kind of term

148
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,120
in a way in which you have
just one order of products

149
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,400
and a little extra
term, rather than

150
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,290
having two complicated terms.

151
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:30,100
So the r can be
written as 1 over me

152
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:45,650
squared alone, p cross L
minus ihp minus r over r.

153
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,243
For example.

154
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:58,410
By writing this term as another
p cross L minus that thing

155
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,550
gives you that expression for r.

156
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,630
You have an
alternative expression

157
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,720
in which you solve
for the other one.

158
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:14,820
So it's 1 over me squared
minus L cross p plus ih bar p.

159
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:27,460
Now, r-- we need to
understand r better.

160
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,930
That's really the challenge
of this whole derivation.

161
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,250
So we have one thing
that is conserved.

162
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,440
Angular momentum is conserved.

163
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,380
It commutes with
the Hamiltonian.

164
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,530
We have another thing
that is conserved, this r.

165
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,200
But we have to understand
better what it is.

166
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,560
So one thing that you can
ask is, well, r is conserved,

167
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,320
so r squared is
conserved as well.

168
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,260
So r squared, if I can simplify
it-- if I can do the algebra

169
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,650
and simplify it-- it should
not be that complicated.

170
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:11,810
So again a practice problem was
given to do that computation.

171
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:17,840
And I think these forms are
useful for that, to work less.

172
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,520
And the computation
gives a very nice result,

173
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:29,340
where r squared is equal
to 1 plus 2 H over me

174
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:35,690
to the fourth L squared
plus h bar squared.

175
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,160
Kind of a strange result
if you think about it.

176
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,380
People that want to
do this classically

177
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,855
first would find that
there's no h squared.

178
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,040
And here, this h, is that
whole h that we have here.

179
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,430
It's a complicated thing.

180
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:00,360
So this right hand side
is quite substantial.

181
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,580
You don't have to worry
that h is in this side

182
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,670
or whether it's
on the other side

183
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:10,480
because h commutes
with L. L is conserved.

184
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,550
So h appears like that.

185
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,376
And this, again, is the
result of another computation.

186
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,120
So we've learned something.

187
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,630
r-- oh, I'm sorry,
this is r squared.

188
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,070
Apologies.

189
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,590
r is conserved.

190
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:34,630
r squared must be conserved
because if h commutes with r

191
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,310
it commutes with
r squared as well.

192
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,050
And therefore whatever you
see on the right hand side,

193
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,810
the whole thing
must be conserved.

194
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,660
And h is conserved, of course.

195
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,320
And L squared is conserved.

196
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,220
Now we need one more property
of a relation-- you see,

197
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,540
you have to do these things.

198
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,470
Even if you probably don't have
an inspiration at this moment

199
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,610
how you're going to
try to understand this,

200
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,935
there are things
that just curiosity

201
00:15:06,935 --> 00:15:09,370
should tell that you should do.

202
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,270
We have L, we do L squared.

203
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,560
It's an important operator.

204
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,060
OK.

205
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,920
We had r, we did r squared,
which is an important operator.

206
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,396
But one thing we
can do is L dot r.

207
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:26,030
It's a good question
what L dot r is.

208
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,430
So what is L dot r?

209
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:47,560
So-- or r dot L. What is it?

210
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,830
Well a few things that
are important to note

211
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:58,902
are that you did
show before that you

212
00:15:58,902 --> 00:16:07,490
know that r dot L,
little r dot L, is 0.

213
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:14,220
And little p dot L is 0.

214
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,500
These are obvious
classically, because L

215
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,210
is perpendicular
to both r and p.

216
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:26,480
But quantum mechanically
they take a little more work.

217
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,170
They're not complicated,
but you've shown those two.

218
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:38,660
So if you have r dot
L, you would have,

219
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,550
for example, here--
r dot L, you would

220
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:50,260
have to do and think
of this whole r

221
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,370
and put an L on the right.

222
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:59,660
Well this little r dotted with
the L on the right would be 0.

223
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:06,569
That p dotted with L on
the right would be 0.

224
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:11,530
And we're almost there,
but p cross L dot L,

225
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,460
well, what is that?

226
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,490
Let me talk about it here.

227
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:24,130
P cross L dot L--
so this is part

228
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,750
of the computation of this
r dot L. We've already

229
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,510
seen this term
will give nothing,

230
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,990
this term will give nothing.

231
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,180
But this term could
give something.

232
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,360
So when you face
something like that,

233
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,900
maybe you say,
well, I don't know

234
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,610
any identities I
should be using here.

235
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,510
So you just do it.

236
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,180
Then you say, this
is i-th component

237
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,460
of this vector times
the i-th of that.

238
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,070
So it's epsilon ijkpjLkLi.

239
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,960
And then you say look this
looks a little-- you could

240
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,850
say many things that are wrong
and get the right answer.

241
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:21,685
So you could say,
oh, ki symmetric

242
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,560
and ki anti-symmetric.

243
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,000
But that's wrong, because
these k and i are not

244
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,280
symmetric really because
these operators don't commute.

245
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:39,730
So the answer will be zero, but
for a more complicated reason.

246
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,600
So what do you have in here?

247
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,930
ki.

248
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,798
Let's move the i to the end
of the epsilon, so jkipjLkLi.

249
00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:02,390
And now you see this part
is pj L cross cross L j.

250
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,740
Is the cross product of this.

251
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,870
But what is L cross L?

252
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,340
You probably remember.

253
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:24,010
This is ih bar L
L cross L, that's

254
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,240
the computation in relation
of angular momentum.

255
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,680
In case you kind
of don't remember

256
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,120
it was ih bar L. Like that.

257
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,190
So now p dot L is anyway 0.

258
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,160
So this is 0.

259
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,485
So it's kind of--
it's a little delicate

260
00:19:48,485 --> 00:19:50,080
to do these computations.

261
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,830
But so since that term is
zero, this thing is zero.

262
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,170
Now you may as
well-- r dot L is 0.

263
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:09,610
Is L dot r also 0?

264
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,150
It's not all that obvious
you can even do that.

265
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,730
Well in a second we'll see
that that's true as well.

266
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:20,840
L dot r and r dot
L, capital R, are 0.

267
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,000
Let's remember-- let's
continue-- let's see,

268
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,510
I wanted to number some
of these equations.

269
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:45,090
We're going to need them.

270
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,850
So this will be equation one.

271
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,030
This will be equation two,
it's an important one.

272
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:11,700
Now what was-- let me
remind you of a notation

273
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,260
we also had about vectors
and their rotations.

274
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,015
Vector under rotations.

275
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:32,020
So what was a vector,
Vi, under rotations

276
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:39,380
was something that you had LiVj
equals ih bar epsilon ijkvk.

277
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:51,760
So there is a way to write
this with cross products that

278
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,500
is useful in some cases.

279
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,270
So I will do it.

280
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,400
You probably have seen
that in the notes,

281
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,090
but let me remind you.

282
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,370
Consider this product,
L cross V plus V

283
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:11,230
cross L and the i-th
component of it.

284
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,440
i-th component of this product.

285
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:25,737
So this is epsilon ijk and
you have LjVk plus VjLk.

286
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:42,160
Now in this term you
can do something nice.

287
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,160
If you think of it
like expanded out,

288
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,580
you have the second
term has epsilon ijkVjk.

289
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:54,730
Change j for k.

290
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,286
If you change j for
k, this will be VkLj.

291
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,320
And these would have
the opposite order.

292
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,460
But this order can be changed
up to the cost of a minus sign.

293
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:14,832
So I claim this is ijk-- first
term is the same-- minus VkLj.

294
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,920
So in the second term,
for this term alone, we've

295
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,960
done for this term, multiplied
with this of course,

296
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,560
we've done j and k relabeling.

297
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:46,320
But this is nothing else than
the commutator of L with V.

298
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,790
So this is epsilon ijkLjVk.

299
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:05,560
That's epsilon ijk, and
this is epsilon jkp or LVL.

300
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,380
Now, 2 epsilons with
2 common indices

301
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,410
is something that it simple.

302
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,150
It's a commutator dealt
on the other indices.

303
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,740
Now it's better if they are sort
of all aligned in the same way,

304
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,140
but they kind of are because
this L, without paying a price,

305
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,830
can be put as the first index.

306
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,080
So you have jk as
the second and third

307
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,290
and-- jk as the
second and third--

308
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:44,230
once L has been moved
to the first position.

309
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:52,720
So this thing is
2 times delta iL.

310
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,660
And there's an h bar,
ih bar I forgot here.

311
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,070
ih bar.

312
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:06,410
2 delta ik ih bar iL ih bar VL.

313
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,070
So this is 2 ih bar Vi.

314
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,610
So this whole thing the i-th
component of this thing,

315
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,720
using this commutation
relation is this.

316
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,060
So what we've learned
is that L cross

317
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:33,820
V plus V cross L you
see go to 2 ih bar V.

318
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:42,430
And that's a statement as a
vector relation of the fact

319
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,160
that V is a vector
in the rotations.

320
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:52,830
So for V to be a vector in
the rotations means this.

321
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:57,200
And if you wish, it
means this thing as well.

322
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,470
It's just another
thing of what it means.

323
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:05,280
Now R is a vector
in the rotations.

324
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,980
This capital R. Why?

325
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:15,850
You've shown that if you have
a vector in the rotations

326
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,670
and you multiply it by another
vector in the rotations

327
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,510
under the cross
product, it's still

328
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,040
a vector in the rotations.

329
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,810
So this is a vector in
the rotations, this is,

330
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,850
and this is a vector
in the rotations.

331
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,620
R is a vector in the rotations.

332
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:45,630
So this capital R is a
vector on the rotations,

333
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,110
which means two things.

334
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:52,890
It means it satisfies
this kind of equation.

335
00:26:52,890 --> 00:27:19,910
So r cross-- or L cross R plus
R cross L is equal to ih bar R.

336
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,570
So R is a vector
in the rotation.

337
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:27,330
It's a fact beyond doubt.

338
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,030
And that means that we now
know the commutation relations

339
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:35,060
between L and R. So we're
starting to put together

340
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:39,160
this picture in which
we get familiar with R

341
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,950
and the commutators
that are possible.

342
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,470
So I can summarize it here.

343
00:27:55,170 --> 00:28:03,900
L dot R LiRj is ih
bar epsilon ijkRk.

344
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:12,900
That's the same statement as
this one but in components.

345
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:23,140
And now you see why R dot
L is equal to L dot R.

346
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:29,150
Because actually if you put the
same two indices here, i and i,

347
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,130
you get zero.

348
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:39,410
So when you have R dot L you
have R1L1 plus R2L2 plus R3L3.

349
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,700
And each of these
two commute when

350
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,740
the two indices are the same.

351
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,090
Because of the epsilon.

352
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,640
So R dot L is 0.

353
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:54,710
And now you also appreciate
that L dot R is also 0, too.

354
00:29:00,226 --> 00:29:00,725
OK.

355
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:09,440
Now comes, in a sense, the most
difficult of all calculations.

356
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,840
Even if this seemed
a little easy.

357
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,680
But you can get
quite far with it.

358
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,800
So what do you do with Ls?

359
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,550
You computed L
commutators and you

360
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,750
got the algebra of
angular momentum.

361
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,810
Over here.

362
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,440
This is the algebra
for angular momentum.

363
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,610
And this kind of
nontrivial calculation,

364
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,560
you did it by building results.

365
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,510
You knew how R was a
vector in the rotation

366
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,430
or how p was a vector
in the rotation.

367
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:48,170
You multiplied the two of them,
and it was not so difficult.

368
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:54,070
But the calculation that
you really need to do now

369
00:29:54,070 --> 00:30:01,540
is the calculation of the
commutator say of Ri with Rj.

370
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,340
And that looks like a
little bit of a nightmare.

371
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:10,420
You have to commute this
whole thing with itself.

372
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,750
Lots of p's, L's, R's.

373
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,790
1 over R's, those
don't commute with p.

374
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,870
You remember that.

375
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,550
So this kind of calculation
done by brute force.

376
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:25,120
You're talking a day, probably.

377
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,690
I think so.

378
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,500
And probably it
becomes a mess, but.

379
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,160
You'll find a little trick
helps to organize it better.

380
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,380
It's less of a
mess, but still you

381
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,200
don't get it and--
try several times.

382
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,320
So what we're going
to do is try to think

383
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,550
of what the answer could
be by some arguments.

384
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:50,210
And then once we know
what the answer can be,

385
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,020
there's still one
calculation to be done.

386
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,780
That I will probably
put in the notes,

387
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,050
but it's not a difficult one.

388
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,420
And the answer just pops out.

389
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:10,220
So the question is what is R
cross R. R cross R is really

390
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:14,040
what we have when we
have this commutator.

391
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:19,650
So we need to know what R cross
R is, just like L cross L.

392
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:25,420
Now R is not likely to
be an angular momentum.

393
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,880
It's a vector but it's
not an angular momentum.

394
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,610
Has nothing to do with it.

395
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,270
It's more complicated.

396
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:36,140
So what is R cross R
quantum-mechanically?

397
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:40,200
Classically, of course,
it would be zero.

398
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:46,230
So first thing is you think
of what this should be.

399
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:56,720
We have a vector, because the
cross product of two vectors.

400
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,900
Now I want to emphasize
one other thing,

401
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:08,870
that it should be this
thing-- R cross R-- is

402
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,330
tantamount to this thing.

403
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,590
What is this thing?

404
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,660
It should be
actually proportional

405
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,675
to some conserved quantity.

406
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:26,640
And the reason is
quite interesting.

407
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,545
So this is a small aside here.

408
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,870
If some operator
is conserved, it

409
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,440
commutes with the Hamiltonian.

410
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:52,595
Say if S1 and S2 are symmetries,
that means that S1 with h

411
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:59,506
is equal to S2 with
h is equal to zero.

412
00:32:59,506 --> 00:33:05,580
Then the claim is that the
commutator of this S1 and S2

413
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:12,255
claim S1 commutator with
S2 is also a symmetry.

414
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,120
So the reason is
because commutator

415
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:29,425
of S1 S2 commutator with h
is equal actually to zero.

416
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:32,500
And why would it
be equal to zero?

417
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,840
It's because of the
so-called Jacobi

418
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,580
identity for commutators.

419
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,930
You'll remember when you
have three things like that,

420
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:46,355
this term is equal to
1-- this term plus 1,

421
00:33:46,355 --> 00:33:48,050
in which you cycle them.

422
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:51,390
And plus another one
where you cycle them again

423
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,230
is equal to zero.

424
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,600
That's a Jacobi identity.

425
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,460
And in those cyclings
you get an h with S2,

426
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,710
for example, that is zero.

427
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,090
And then an h with
S1, which is zero.

428
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:08,310
So you use these things
here and you prove that.

429
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,959
So I write here, by Jacobi.

430
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,520
So if you have a
conserved-- this

431
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,630
is the great thing about
conserved quantities,

432
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:24,050
if you have one conserved
quantity, it's OK.

433
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,300
But if you have two,
you're in business.

434
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,985
Because you can then take the
commutator of these two and you

435
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,400
get another conserved quantity.

436
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,830
And then more commutators and
you keep taking commutators

437
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:39,420
and if you're lucky you get all
of the conserved quantities.

438
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:45,480
So here R cross R refers
to this commutator.

439
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,670
So whatever is on the
right should be a vector

440
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,375
and should be conserved.

441
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:03,270
And what are our
conserved vectors?

442
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:11,210
Well our conserved
vectors-- candidates here--

443
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:25,130
are L, R itself, and L cross
R. That's pretty much it.

444
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:30,330
L and R are our only conserved
things, so it better be that.

445
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:39,370
Still this is far too much.

446
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,330
So there could be
a term proportional

447
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:46,650
to L, a term proportional to R,
a term proportional to L dot R.

448
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:51,940
So this kind of analysis
is based by something

449
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,760
that Julian Schwinger did.

450
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,090
This same guy that
actually did quantum

451
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,940
electrodynamics along
with Feynman and Tomonaga.

452
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,360
And he's the one of
those who invented

453
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,870
the trick of using
three-dimensional angular

454
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,770
momentum for the
two-dimensional oscillator.

455
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,860
And had lots of bags of tricks.

456
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,920
So actually this whole
discussion of the hydrogen

457
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,200
atom-- most books just say,
well, these calculations are

458
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,810
hopeless.

459
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:25,330
Let me give you the answers.

460
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,780
Schwinger, on the other hand, in
his book on quantum mechanics--

461
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:33,940
which is kind of interesting
but very idiosyncratic--

462
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,910
finds a trick to do
every calculation.

463
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:41,230
So you never get
into a big mess.

464
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,980
He's absolutely elegant
and keeps pulling tricks

465
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,700
from the bag.

466
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,830
So this is one of those tricks.

467
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:54,180
Basically he goes through
the following analysis now

468
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:59,490
and says, look, suppose
I have the vector R

469
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,960
and I do a parity
transformation.

470
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,490
I change it for minus R.

471
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:10,010
What happens under
those circumstances?

472
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:15,950
Well the momentum is
the rate of change of R,

473
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,260
should also change sign.

474
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,840
Quantum mechanically
this is consistent,

475
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,590
because a commutation between
R and p should give you h bar.

476
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:31,810
And if R changes, p
should change sign.

477
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:37,530
But now when you do this,
L, which is R cross p,

478
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:47,960
just goes to L. And R,
however, changes sign

479
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,320
because L doesn't change
sign but p does and R does.

480
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,330
So under these changes--
so this is the originator,

481
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:00,140
the troublemaker and
then everybody else

482
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:04,875
follows-- R also changes sign.

483
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,100
So this is extremely powerful
because if you imagine

484
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,840
this being equal to
something, well it

485
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,980
should be consistent
with the symmetries.

486
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:28,470
So as I change R to minus
R, capital R changes sign

487
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:32,550
but the left hand side
doesn't change sign.

488
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:36,210
Therefore the right hand
side should not change sign.

489
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:42,080
And R changes sign and
L cross R changes sign.

490
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,590
So computation kind of
finished because the only thing

491
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:53,220
you can get on the right is L.

492
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,520
This is the kind of
thing that you do

493
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,910
and probably if you
were writing a paper on

494
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,400
that you would anyway
do the calculation.

495
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,420
The silly way,
the- the right way.

496
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,880
But this is quite save of times.

497
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,300
So actually what
you have learned

498
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:24,940
is that R cross R is equal to
some scalar conserved quantity,

499
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,240
which is something that
is conserved that could

500
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,020
be like an h, for example, here.

501
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,130
But it's a scalar.

502
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:37,480
And, L.

503
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,290
Well once you know that much,
it doesn't take much work

504
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:43,810
to do this and to
calculate what it is.

505
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:47,670
But I will skip
that calculation.

506
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,440
This is the sort of
thoughtful part of it.

507
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:59,820
And R cross R turns out to
be ih bar minus 2 h again.

508
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:04,060
h shows up in several
places, like here,

509
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:08,920
so it tends-- it has
a tendency to show up.

510
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:16,210
me to the fourth L.

511
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:24,640
So this is our equation
for-- and in a sense,

512
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,020
all the hard work has been done.

513
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:32,940
Because now you have a complete
understanding of these two

514
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,470
vectors, L and R. You
know what L squared is,

515
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,235
what R squared is,
what L dot R is.

516
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:41,115
And you know all
the commutators,

517
00:40:41,115 --> 00:40:46,600
you know the commutation of L
with L, L with R, and R with R.

518
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,140
You've done all
the algebraic work.

519
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,360
And the question is, how
do we proceed from now

520
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,960
to solve the hydrogen atom.

521
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,610
So the way we proceed
is kind of interesting.

522
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:07,270
We're going to try to
build from this L that

523
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,530
is an angular momentum.

524
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:14,890
And this R that is not
an angular momentum.

525
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:18,300
Two sets of angular momenta.

526
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,620
You have two vectors.

527
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,730
So somehow we want to try to
combine them in such a way

528
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:27,500
that we can invent
two angular momenta.

529
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,070
Just like the
angular momentum in

530
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,810
the two-dimensional
harmonic oscillator.

531
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:37,860
It was not directly
through angular momentum,

532
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,450
but was mathematical
angular momentum.

533
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:43,910
These two angular momenta we're
going to build, one of them

534
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,870
is going to be recognizable.

535
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,130
The other one is going to
be a little unfamiliar.

536
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,540
But now I have to do
something that-- it

537
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:00,380
may sound a little
unusual, but is

538
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,570
necessary to simplify our life.

539
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:07,120
I want to say some
words that will

540
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:13,640
allow me to think of
this h here as a number.

541
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:19,280
And would allow me to think
of this h as a number.

542
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,150
So here's what
we're going to say.

543
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:25,025
It's an assumption--
it's no assumption,

544
00:42:25,025 --> 00:42:27,180
but it sounds like
an assumption.

545
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,330
But there's no
assumption whatsoever.

546
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:33,880
We say the following:
this hydrogen atom

547
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,990
is going to have some states.

548
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:44,590
So let's assume there is one
state, and it has some energy.

549
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:48,180
If I have that state
with some energy, well,

550
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,360
that would be the
end of the story.

551
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,570
But in fact, the
thing that they want

552
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:57,200
to allow the possibility for is
that at that the energy there

553
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,870
are more states.

554
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:04,070
One state would be OK,
maybe sometimes it happens.

555
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:08,250
But in general there are
more states at that energy.

556
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:13,370
So I don't-- I'm not making any
physical assumption to state

557
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:18,040
that there is a subspace
of degenerate states.

558
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,530
And in that subspace
of degenerate states,

559
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,820
there may be just one
state, there are two states,

560
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,278
there are three
states, but there's

561
00:43:26,278 --> 00:43:31,740
subspace of degenerate
states that have some energy.

562
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:35,750
And I'm going to work
in that subspace.

563
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,830
And all the
operators that I have

564
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,500
are going to be acting
in that subspace.

565
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,790
And I'm going to
analyze subspace

566
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,840
by subspace of
different energies.

567
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,320
So we're going to
work with one subspace

568
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,480
of degenerate energies.

569
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,750
And if I have, for example,
the operator R squared

570
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:58,580
acting on any state
of that subspace,

571
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,390
since h commutes
with L squared, h

572
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,740
can go here, acts on this
thing, becomes a number.

573
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,460
So you might as well
put a number here.

574
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,440
You might as well put
a number here as well.

575
00:44:13,272 --> 00:44:15,370
It has to be stated like that.

576
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:15,870
Carefully.

577
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:18,450
We're going to work on
a degenerate subspace

578
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,550
of some energy.

579
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:24,050
But then we can treat
the h as a number.

580
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,800
So let me say it here.

581
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:38,220
We'll work in a
degenerate subspace

582
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:50,080
with eigenvalues of h equal
to h prime, for h prime.

583
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:56,100
Now I want to write some numbers
here to simplify my algebra.

584
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,030
So without loss of
generality we put

585
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:08,185
what this dimensionless--
this is dimensionless.

586
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:13,010
I'm sorry, this is
not dimensionless.

587
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:16,770
This one has units of energy.

588
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:19,660
This is roughly
the right energy,

589
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:24,050
with this one would be the right
energy for the ground state.

590
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,530
Now we don't know
the energies and this

591
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,850
is going to give us
the energies as well.

592
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,810
So without solving the
differential equation,

593
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,580
we're going to get the energies.

594
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,680
So if I say, well that's
the energies you would say,

595
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,830
come on, you're cheating.

596
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:44,190
So I'll put one over nu squared
where nu can be anything.

597
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,045
Nu is real.

598
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:50,540
And that's just a
way to write things

599
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,610
in order to simplify
the algebra.

600
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:55,190
I don't know what nu is.

601
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:58,180
How you say-- you don't know,
but you have this in mind

602
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,450
and it's going to
be an integer, sure.

603
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,030
That's what good
notation is all about.

604
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:06,700
You write things and
then, you know, it's nu.

605
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,280
You don't call it N. Because
you don't know it's an integer.

606
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,900
You call it nu, and you proceed.

607
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,980
So once you have
called it nu, you

608
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:22,440
see here that, well, that's
what we call h really.

609
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,240
h will be-- this h prime
is kind of not necessary.

610
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,950
This is what-- where h
becomes in every formula.

611
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:38,110
So from here you get that
minus 2h over me to the fourth

612
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:41,490
is 1 over h squared nu squared.

613
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,970
I have a minus here, I'm sorry.

614
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:53,340
2h minus me to the fourth
down is h squared nu squared.

615
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:58,190
So we can substitute
that in our nice formulas

616
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:04,790
that hme to the fourth so
our formulas four and five

617
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:08,745
have become-- I'm going
to use this blackboard.

618
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:18,010
Any blackboard where I
don't have a formula boxed

619
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:18,880
can be erased.

620
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,550
So I will continue here.

621
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:31,720
And so what do we have?

622
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:40,240
R cross R, from that
formula, well this thing

623
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,650
is over there minus 2h
over me to the fourth,

624
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:45,090
you substitute it in here.

625
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:49,680
So it's i over h
bar, one over nu

626
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,700
squared L. Doesn't
look that bad.

627
00:47:53,700 --> 00:48:05,260
And, R squared is equal to 1
minus 1 over h bar nu squared.

628
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,760
Like this.

629
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,745
L squared plus h squared.

630
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,204
2h, that's minus h
squared nu squared.

631
00:48:16,204 --> 00:48:18,180
Yeah.

632
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,650
So these are nice formulas.

633
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:24,570
These are already quite clean.

634
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,205
We'll call them
five, equation five.

635
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:37,330
I still want to rewrite
them in a way that perhaps

636
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:41,380
is a little more
understandable or suggestive.

637
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:45,230
I will put an h bar nu
together with each R.

638
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:55,260
So h nu R cross h
nu R is equal to ih

639
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:01,720
bar L. Makes it look nice.

640
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,440
Then for this one
you'll put h squared

641
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:16,150
nu squared R squared is equal
to h squared nu squared minus 1

642
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:19,420
minus L squared.

643
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,190
It's sort of trivial algebra.

644
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:25,980
You multiply by h squared
nu squared, you get this.

645
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:31,260
You get h squared nu squared
minus L squared because it's

646
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,010
all multiplied minus h squared.

647
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:41,370
So these two equations,
five, have become six.

648
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:45,810
So five and six are
really the same equations.

649
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:49,760
Nothing much has been done.

650
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,080
And if you wish, in
terms of commutators

651
00:49:55,080 --> 00:50:05,590
this equation says that the
commutator h nu Ri with h nu Rj

652
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:09,640
is equal to ih
bar epsilon ijkLk.

653
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:22,250
H cross this thing h nu R, h nu
R cross equal iHL in components

654
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,070
means this.

655
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:28,770
That is not totally obvious.

656
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:32,850
It requires a small computation,
but is the same computation

657
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:35,820
that shows that
this thing is really

658
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:42,420
LiLj equal ih bar epsilon ijkLk.

659
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:45,850
In which these L's
have now become R's.

660
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:54,430
OK so, we've cleaned
up everything.

661
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:01,550
We've made great progress
even though at this moment

662
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:04,745
it still looks like we haven't
solved the problem at all.

663
00:51:04,745 --> 00:51:07,320
But we're very close.

664
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:12,510
So are there any questions
about what we've done so far?

665
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:17,350
Have I lost you in the
algebra, or any goals here?

666
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:18,100
Yes.

667
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,490
AUDIENCE: Why is R cross
R not a commutation?

668
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:25,440
Why would we expect that
to not be a commutation?

669
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,480
PROFESSOR: In general, it's
the same thing as here.

670
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,590
L cross L is this.

671
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:38,380
The commutator of two Hermitian
operators is anti-Hermitian.

672
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,600
So there's always
an i over there.

673
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:45,240
Other questions?

674
00:51:48,232 --> 00:51:49,690
It's good, you have
to-- you should

675
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,386
worry about those things.

676
00:51:52,386 --> 00:51:56,020
Are the units right, or
the right number of i's

677
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,550
on the right hand side.

678
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:01,150
That's a great way
to catch mistakes.

679
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:05,050
OK so we're there.

680
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:08,360
And now it should
really almost look

681
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,490
reasonable to do what
we're going to do.

682
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:15,876
h nu R with h nu R
gives you like L.

683
00:52:15,876 --> 00:52:20,980
So you have L with L,
form angular momentum.

684
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:25,630
L and R are vectors in
their angular momentum.

685
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:30,680
Now R cross R is L.
And with these units,

686
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,570
h nu R and h nu R
looks like it has

687
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:37,940
the units of angular momentum.

688
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:43,290
So h nu R can be added
to angular momentum

689
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:45,840
to form more angular momentum.

690
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,100
So that's exactly what
we're going to do.

691
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,170
So here it comes.

692
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:54,820
Key step.

693
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,580
J1-- I'm going to define
two angular momenta.

694
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,145
Well, we hope that they
are angular momenta.

695
00:53:04,145 --> 00:53:18,707
L plus h nu R. And J2, one
half L minus h nu R. These

696
00:53:18,707 --> 00:53:19,373
are definitions.

697
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:26,340
It's just defining
two operators.

698
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,775
We hope something good
happens with these operators,

699
00:53:29,775 --> 00:53:32,530
but at this moment
you don't know.

700
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:36,130
It's a good suggestion
because of the units

701
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,660
match and all that stuff.

702
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:44,200
So this is going to be
our definitions, seven.

703
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:50,490
And from these of course follows
that L, the quantity we know,

704
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:53,654
is J1 plus J2.

705
00:53:53,654 --> 00:53:59,360
And R, or h nu R,
is J1 minus J2.

706
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:07,600
You solve in the other way.

707
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:15,200
Now my first claim is
that J1 and J2 commute.

708
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,960
Commute with each other.

709
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:32,950
So these are nice,
commuting angular momenta.

710
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:40,150
Now this computation has
to be done-- let me-- yeah,

711
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:42,420
we can do it.

712
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:45,580
J1i with J2J.

713
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:53,720
It's one half and
one half gives you

714
00:54:53,720 --> 00:55:06,920
one quarter of Li plus h nu
Ri with LJ minus h nu RJ.

715
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:15,430
Now the question
is where do I-- I

716
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:17,970
think I can erase most
of this blackboard.

717
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:26,300
I can leave this formula.

718
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:31,445
It's kind of the only
very much needed one.

719
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:38,990
So I'll continue with
this computation here.

720
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:45,650
This gives me one quarter-- and
we have a big parentheses-- ih

721
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,040
bar epsilon iJkLk.

722
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:53,470
For the commutator of these two.

723
00:55:53,470 --> 00:56:00,680
And then you have the
commutator of the cross terms.

724
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,320
So what do they look like?

725
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:19,690
They look like minus h nu
Li with RJ, and minus h

726
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:25,995
nu Ri with-- no.

727
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:36,810
So I have minus h nu
Li with RJ, and now I

728
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,720
have a plus of this term.

729
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:44,565
But I will write this as a
minus h nu of LJ with Ri.

730
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:50,150
Those are the two
cross products.

731
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:56,827
And then finally we have this
thing, the h nu with h nu Rijk.

732
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:11,914
So I have minus h nu squared,
and you have then RiRJk.

733
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,940
No, I'll do it this way.

734
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,290
I'm sorry.

735
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:26,180
You have minus over there,
and I have this thing

736
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:35,210
so it's minus ih bar epsilon
iJkLk from the last two

737
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:36,230
commutators.

738
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:40,445
So this one you use
essentially equation six.

739
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,025
Now look.

740
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,860
This thing and
this thing cancels.

741
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:56,650
And these two terms, they
actually cancel as well.

742
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:00,365
Because here you
get an epsilon iJR.

743
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:06,560
And here there's an
epsilon Ji something.

744
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:10,880
So these two terms
actually add up to zero.

745
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,000
And this is zero.

746
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:20,050
So indeed, J1i and
J2i-- 2J-- is zero.

747
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:25,150
And these are commuting things.

748
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,540
I wanted to say commuting
angular momentum,

749
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:30,280
but not quite yet.

750
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,520
Haven't shown their
angular momenta.

751
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:38,520
So how do we show
their angular momenta?

752
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:43,790
We have to try it and
see if they really

753
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:46,660
do form an algebra
of angular momentum.

754
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:53,280
So again, for saving room, I'm
going to erase this formula.

755
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,470
It will reappear
in lecture notes.

756
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:57,760
But now it should go.

757
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,460
So the next computation is
something that I want to do.

758
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:13,080
J1 cross J1 or the
J2 cross J2, to see

759
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,590
if they form angular momenta.

760
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:17,940
And I want to do
them simultaneously,

761
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:26,370
so I will do one
quarter of J1 cross

762
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:40,680
J2 would be L plus minus h nu
R cross L plus minus h nu R.

763
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:45,680
OK that doesn't look bad at
all, especially because we

764
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:50,350
have all these
formulas for products.

765
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:55,500
So look, you have L
cross L, which we know.

766
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,720
Then you have L cross
R plus R cross L

767
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,950
that is conveniently here.

768
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:08,350
And finally, you have R
cross R which is here.

769
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:11,860
So it's all sort
of done in a way

770
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:15,220
that the composition
should be easy.

771
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:19,560
So indeed 1 over 4
L cross L gives you

772
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:26,820
an ih bar L. From L
cross L. From these ones,

773
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,910
you get plus minus
with plus minus.

774
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:33,780
It's always plus but
you get another ihL.

775
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,560
So you get another ihL.

776
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:49,050
And then you get plus minus
L cross h nu R plus h nu R

777
01:00:49,050 --> 01:01:00,710
cross L. So here you get
one quarter of 2 ihL.

778
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:08,590
And look at this formula, just
put an h nu here and h nu here

779
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:10,840
and an h nu here.

780
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:25,420
So you get plus minus 2 ih
from here and an h nu R.

781
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:31,720
OK so the twos and the fours
and the iH's go out and then you

782
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:39,652
get ih times one half
times L plus minus h nu R,

783
01:01:39,652 --> 01:01:46,130
which is either J1 or J2.

784
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:50,810
So, very nicely,
we've shown that J1

785
01:01:50,810 --> 01:02:02,680
cross J1 is ih bar J1 and
J2 cross J2 is ih bar J2.

786
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,640
And now finally you
can say that you've

787
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:16,120
discovered two independent
angular momenta in the hydrogen

788
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:16,840
atom.

789
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:21,520
You did have an angular
momentum on an R vector,

790
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,940
and all of our work has
gone into showing now

791
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,855
that you have two
angular momenta.

792
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:36,150
Pretty much we're
at the end of this

793
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:43,620
because, after we do one more
little thing, we're there.

794
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,255
So let me do it here.

795
01:02:53,987 --> 01:02:58,630
I will not need these
equations anymore.

796
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:00,810
Except this one I will need.

797
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,686
So

798
01:03:19,686 --> 01:03:23,580
L dot R is zero.

799
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:27,740
So from L dot R
equals zero, this time

800
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:37,060
you get J1 plus J2 is
equal to-- no, times--

801
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:41,430
J1 minus J2 is equal to zero.

802
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:45,080
Now J1 and J2 commute.

803
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,800
So the cross terms vanish.

804
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,410
J1 and J2 commute.

805
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:55,920
So this implies that J1
squared is equal to J2 squared.

806
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:10,120
Now this is a very
surprising thing.

807
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:14,530
These two angular momenta
have the same length squared.

808
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:18,370
Let's look a little more at
the length squared of it.

809
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:21,370
So let's, for
example, square J1.

810
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:33,850
Well, if I square J1, I have one
fourth L squared plus h squared

811
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:36,470
nu squared R squared.

812
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:42,090
No L dot R term,
because L dot R is 0.

813
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:47,530
And h squared nu squared
R squared is here.

814
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:49,650
So this is good news.

815
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:56,150
This is one fourth L
squared plus h squared

816
01:04:56,150 --> 01:05:00,620
nu squared minus
1 minus L squared.

817
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:03,720
The L squared cancels.

818
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:09,020
And you've got that J1
equals to J2 squared.

819
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:22,680
And it's equal to one fourth of
h squared nu squared minus 1.

820
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:26,125
OK.

821
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,330
Well the problem
has been solved,

822
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:35,170
even if you don't
notice at this moment.

823
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:37,530
It's all solved.

824
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,490
Why?

825
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:42,210
You've been talking
a degenerate subspace

826
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:47,220
with angular momentum
with equal energies.

827
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:50,610
And there's two
angular momenta there.

828
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:54,480
And their squares equal
to the same thing.

829
01:05:54,480 --> 01:06:00,250
So these two angular
momenta, our squares

830
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:04,800
are the same and the
square is precisely what

831
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:13,390
we call h squared J times J
plus 1, where j J is quantized.

832
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:19,520
It can be zero, one
half, one, all of this.

833
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:23,350
So here comes a quantization.

834
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:27,480
J squared being nu squared, we
didn't know what nu squared is,

835
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,830
but it's now equal
to these things.

836
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:36,490
So at this moment, things
have been quantized.

837
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:41,520
And let's look into a little
more detail what has happened

838
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,780
and confirm that we got
everything we wanted.

839
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:00,680
So let me write that
equation again here.

840
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:07,040
J1 squared is equal J2 squared
is equal to one quarter

841
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:10,670
h squared nu squared
minus 1, which

842
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:16,110
is h squared J times J plus 1.

843
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:22,740
So cancel the h squares
and solve for nu squared.

844
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:28,580
Nu squared would
be 1 plus 4J times

845
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:36,380
J plus 1, which is 4J
squared plus 4J plus 1,

846
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:39,660
which is 2J plus 1 squared.

847
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:44,550
That's pretty neat.

848
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:46,210
Why is it so neat?

849
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:53,220
Because as J is equal to
zero, all the possible values

850
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:55,860
of angular momentum--
three halves,

851
01:07:55,860 --> 01:08:01,780
all these things-- nu,
which is 2J plus 1,

852
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:14,220
will be equal to 1, 2,
3, 4-- all the integers.

853
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:17,292
And what was nu?

854
01:08:17,292 --> 01:08:20,609
It was the values
of the energies.

855
01:08:20,609 --> 01:08:26,420
So actually you've
proven the spectrum.

856
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:31,420
Nu has come out to
be either 1, 2, 3,

857
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:35,360
but you have all representations
of angular momentum.

858
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,630
You have the
singlet, the spin one

859
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:40,930
half-- where are the spins here?

860
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:42,000
Nowhere.

861
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,950
There was an electron,
a proton, we never

862
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:47,240
put spin for the hydrogen atom.

863
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:51,180
But it all shows up as
these representations

864
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:53,880
in which they come along.

865
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,740
Even more is true, as
we will see right away

866
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:02,160
and confirm that everything
really shows up the right way.

867
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:06,120
So what happened now?

868
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:11,950
We have two independent,
equal angular momentum.

869
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:16,149
So what is this degenerate
subspace we were inventing?

870
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:24,000
Is the space J, which is
J1 and m1 tensor product

871
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,310
with J, which is J2
but has the same value

872
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:31,029
because the squares
are the same, m2.

873
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:39,350
So this is an uncoupled basis.

874
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:45,000
Uncoupled basis of states
in the degenerate subspace.

875
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:50,720
And now, you know, it's
all a little surreal

876
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:55,350
because these don't look
like our states at all.

877
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:58,780
But this is the way
algebraically they show up.

878
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:05,260
We choose our value of J, we
have then that nu is equal

879
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:09,270
to this and for that value of
J there's some values of m's.

880
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:13,470
And therefore, this must
be the degenerate subspace.

881
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:17,890
So this is nothing
but the tensor product

882
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:22,220
of a J multiplet
with a J multiplet.

883
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:29,120
Where J is that integer here.

884
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,400
And what is the tensor
product of a J multiplet?

885
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,200
First, J is for J1.

886
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,487
The second J is for J2.

887
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:46,220
So at this moment
of course we're

888
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:51,680
calling this N for
the quantum number.

889
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,250
But what is this thing?

890
01:10:53,250 --> 01:11:01,850
This is 2J plus 2J minus
1 plus-- all the way

891
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:02,810
up to the singlet.

892
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:12,620
But what are these
representations of?

893
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:17,190
Well here we have
J1 and here is J2.

894
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,790
These must be the
ones of the sum.

895
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:22,640
But who is the sum, L?

896
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,640
So these are the L
representations that you get.

897
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,850
L is your angular momentum.

898
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:32,410
L representations.

899
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:39,520
And if 2J plus 1 is N,
you got a representation

900
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:46,170
with L equals N minus
1, because 2J plus 1

901
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:57,190
is N, L equals N minus 2,
all the way up to L equals 0.

902
01:11:57,190 --> 01:12:04,780
Therefore, you get precisely
this whole structure.

903
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:09,870
So, just in time as
we get to 2 o'clock,

904
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:13,520
we've finished the quantization
of the hydrogen atom.

905
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,340
We've finished 805.

906
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:17,560
I hope you enjoyed.

907
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:21,820
I did a lot. [INAUDIBLE]
and Will did, too.

908
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:25,440
Good luck and
we'll see you soon.
