8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,200
PROFESSOR: It's
time to get started.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,040
Today, we'll complete
our discussion

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,020
of nuclear magnetic resonance.

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,290
And we started that last time.

12
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:38,020
And after that, we will talk
about multi-particle states,

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,860
the kind of quantum
mechanical states

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,840
that you need if your system
has more than one particle.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,460
That will bring us
naturally to the idea

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,260
of denser products of
vector spaces, which

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,910
is the key mathematical
idea behind operations

18
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,870
such as addition of
angular momentum.

19
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,980
By introducing a little
before, we really

20
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,460
talk about addition
of angular momentum,

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,350
the idea of denser
products of vector spaces.

22
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,860
I really hope that
this subject will

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,130
look a lot less mysterious
in a couple of weeks

24
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,020
when we will really be
adding angular momentum.

25
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:31,000
So you will have seen the
main mathematical structures.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,790
And you will know
what you're supposed

27
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,350
to do when you have a formula.

28
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,110
So that should be of some help.

29
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,140
So last time, we
were talking about

30
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,770
nuclear magnetic resonance.

31
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,200
And I described the problem.

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,110
Here is a summary of where
more or less we got last time.

33
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,970
We said in the set up for
nuclear magnetic resonance,

34
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:57,250
we have a large magnetic field,
the longitudinal magnetic field

35
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,070
it's sometimes called,
along the z direction.

36
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,860
In addition to that
longitudinal magnetic field,

37
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,289
there's a rotating magnetic
field in the xy plane.

38
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:12,835
And it's rotating in the
direction that you see here.

39
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:20,350
As seen on the xy plane,
it's clockwise on the plane.

40
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,470
In terms of a rotation
around the z direction,

41
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,810
it's negative in the sense
that the positive rotation

42
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,484
around the z plane
would go like this.

43
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,787
And this magnetic
field is rotating

44
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:34,020
in the other direction.

45
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,390
So I wrote it here.

46
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:42,820
The magnitude of this radio
frequency component is B1.

47
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,080
And typically, it's
much smaller than B0

48
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,880
in the problems of interest.

49
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,310
Then, as you recall,
the spin Hamiltonian

50
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,490
is always given by this
constant gamma that

51
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,960
relates to the dipole moment of
a particle to its spin angular

52
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,260
momentum B dot S,
the S operator.

53
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,440
And the S operator
has components

54
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,270
Sx, Sy, Sz multiplied by
B. Well, the z component

55
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:23,172
picks up a z, the x component
Sx, the y component Sy.

56
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:24,380
And this is your Hamiltonian.

57
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,510
And as we emphasized last
time, this Hamiltonian

58
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,880
is time dependent.

59
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,090
Moreover, at different times,
the Hamiltonians don't commute.

60
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:41,370
So the HS at time T1, HS at
time T2, they don't commute.

61
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,770
Therefore, any of the formulas
we have for solving problems

62
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,325
like this don't apply.

63
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,860
The only formula that applies
is this time ordered exponential

64
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,610
that we spoke about
that in general

65
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,500
is very difficult to use.

66
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,770
The time ordered exponential
just never quits.

67
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,520
And we're writing
terms, term after term.

68
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,100
And then, you have
to add it all up.

69
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,110
And adding it all
up is difficult.

70
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,960
So most of the time,
it's not a great help.

71
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,680
So what did we say we would do?

72
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,870
We wondered if we could
somehow do quantum mechanics,

73
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,760
or think of quantum mechanics,
in the rotating frame,

74
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,600
in a frame that is rotating with
a magnetic field in such a way

75
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,460
that perhaps in that frame
the physics would simplify.

76
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,830
And physics simplified would
be that the Hamiltonian becomes

77
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,030
time independent.

78
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,740
So we're trying to figure
out, how would the Hamiltonian

79
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,720
look in another frame?

80
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,380
Now, we've not discussed
in general very explicitly

81
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,620
transformations of Hamiltonians
within different frames.

82
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,750
But we can sort of
roughly try to guess

83
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,320
what it would have to do.

84
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,490
So what we said
last time is that we

85
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,380
would imagine that you
have an original system

86
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,650
and no magnetic field,
nothing whatsoever.

87
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,000
So forget about all
that-- no magnetic field.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,630
You put the spin state.

89
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,980
It stays there forever,
doesn't precess.

90
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,480
It doesn't precess because
there's no magnetic field.

91
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,720
Then, you jump into
a rotating frame.

92
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,600
So this was a static
frame, no magnetic field.

93
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,480
And then, you start rotating.

94
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,220
And then, you look at the spins.

95
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,680
And the spins are not moving.

96
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,020
But you say, oh, I'm rotating.

97
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,425
So for me, they seem to be
precessing, in fact precessing

98
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:49,300
with the angular frequency
that I am rotating.

99
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,800
And therefore, in
my rotating frame,

100
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,680
I would have a
Hamiltonian that I

101
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,100
would call the rotating
Hamiltonian, HR.

102
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,160
And how would it look?

103
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,960
We claim that in fact spin
states in my rotating frame

104
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,700
would have to be
rotating really this way.

105
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,050
Because I'm rotating
with the magnetic field.

106
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,880
So for me, they're rotating
in the positive z direction

107
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,430
with angular frequency omega.

108
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,730
And this would be
the operator that

109
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,970
makes them rotate
exactly that way.

110
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,580
Because if you remember,
an operator here minus

111
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,990
i angle Sz over h
bar, this is the angle

112
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,530
as a function of time.

113
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:43,790
Omega t, that's how these
operators rotate states.

114
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,720
So this U of t is the
U of t that rotates

115
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,150
states the way I want
them in my rotating frame.

116
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,720
Now, you remember for
time independent systems,

117
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:04,560
the unitary operator is e
to the minus iht over h bar.

118
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,340
So you identify the
Hamiltonian as omega Sz.

119
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:18,840
In general, given
a unitary operator,

120
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,120
the Hamiltonian is
obtained this way.

121
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,620
You take the time derivative
of it multiplied by U dagger.

122
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,080
And that's the formula for
the Hamiltonian given the time

123
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,220
evolution operator, something
we did about a couple of weeks

124
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,640
ago.

125
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,900
So that's where we stood-- some
idea about the rotating frame.

126
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,930
So the way we now
make this complete

127
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,290
is to say, well, I'm going to
attempt to do the following.

128
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:59,282
I'm going to act with U, this U
of t, on this complicated state

129
00:07:59,282 --> 00:08:02,590
that I don't know
how it behaves.

130
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:09,100
And this I'm going to call
the rotated wave function.

131
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,740
It's a definition.

132
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,800
We're going to use
this operator that

133
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,200
seems to induce a
rotation of the frames

134
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,630
and act it on the
state to find this.

135
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,290
And we're going to hope
that the Schrodinger

136
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,970
equation for this
one is simpler.

137
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,239
So actually, last time, I
actually did a computation

138
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:36,980
and found what is the
Schrodinger Hamiltonian

139
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:43,390
for this, psi R. I want to do
it in a slightly different way.

140
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:48,190
I think it's a little easier
perhaps, or maybe less

141
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,670
familiar but more interesting.

142
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,300
I write this like that-- U of t.

143
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,625
And I say, look,
this state evolves

144
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,470
due to its own Hamiltonian.

145
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,840
U of t is an extra
thing I've put here.

146
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,710
So here is U of t.

147
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,240
But how do I distinguish it?

148
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:15,390
I put an S for the spin
system, for HS, psi 0.

149
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:22,430
So psi of t is being evolved
by the Schrodinger Hamiltonian,

150
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,120
the unitary operator
associated to the Hamiltonian

151
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,030
that we want times time of 0.

152
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:34,320
So this is the total
unitary operator

153
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,660
that evolves this state.

154
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,490
Therefore, I'm going
to say, I'm going

155
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,190
to recover the Hamiltonian
using this formula.

156
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:51,190
So I will simply say that
the rotating Hamiltonian

157
00:09:51,190 --> 00:10:04,660
is going to be HR is ih bar
dt of this whole thing, U

158
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:11,420
of t US of t, times its dagger.

159
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,045
Because this is
the general formula

160
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,180
to obtain the
Hamiltonian when you

161
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,560
know the time
evolution operator.

162
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:24,290
So the dagger of this would
be US dagger U of t dagger.

163
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,370
Now we have to evaluate
this derivative.

164
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,410
It's is not all that bad.

165
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,850
If the time
derivative hits the U,

166
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:43,480
this one, then U and U
dagger annihilate each other.

167
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,170
So you're left with
U dagger of t here.

168
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:56,430
So you get ih bar dtU U dagger.

169
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,640
Now, when it acts on this
second one, what do we get?

170
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,590
Well, I'll write it this way.

171
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,860
Plus U of t, because
this will be first.

172
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,787
Then, ih bar dtUS.

173
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:24,260
And then, you have US dagger,
and then U dagger of t.

174
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,840
Now, this thing is how much?

175
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,530
Well, in this thing is
in fact this Hamiltonian

176
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:45,070
associated to what we called
U, which is just omega Sz.

177
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,610
So actually, I don't
know if I have-- yeah,

178
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,370
I have this notation here.

179
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:59,570
I think it's useful-- H of
U, the Hamiltonian associated

180
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,550
to whatever U it is.

181
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:07,740
So you get a nice
formula-- plus U of t.

182
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:14,941
This is the Hamiltonian
HS U dagger of t.

183
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,290
So this formula we
derived also last time

184
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:29,850
by looking at the differential
equations satisfied by psi R.

185
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,690
So it's a nice formula.

186
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,700
If somebody gives you
something like this

187
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,920
and says, here's a
unitary operator,

188
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,200
what is the new Hamiltonian?

189
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:47,550
The new Hamiltonian is equal to
the transformed old Hamiltonian

190
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,220
plus the Hamiltonian associated
to this time evolution

191
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,115
operator.

192
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:53,530
It's a nice formula.

193
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,300
Now, more concretely
now, we can see

194
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,840
what this is supposed to be.

195
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:08,625
So here is the
important crucial step.

196
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:13,170
Let's see, HR is
supposed to be what?

197
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:18,290
We now know we're going to
choose U to be this thing.

198
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:25,050
Therefore, HU is omega Sz hat.

199
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:30,540
But now we have U
of t, U dagger of t.

200
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,720
So I have plus e to
the minus i omega

201
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:42,880
tSz over h bar times
the Hamiltonian

202
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,900
that we have over there,
this full Hamiltonian HS.

203
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,614
So what is it?

204
00:13:49,614 --> 00:14:01,050
Minus gamma big parentheses
B0 Sz hat plus B1 cosine omega

205
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:11,150
tSx minus sine omega
tSy-- like that--

206
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:16,510
e to the i omega tSz over h bar.

207
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,260
OK, that's supposed to
be our new Hamiltonian.

208
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,170
And unless it simplifies, we
have not gained all that much.

209
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:34,410
So before simplifying,
are there questions,

210
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,225
anything we've gotten so far?

211
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:41,440
Yes.

212
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,284
AUDIENCE: So U of t is
the unitary operator that

213
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:50,693
enacts the rotation,
and it's not

214
00:14:50,693 --> 00:14:55,780
corresponding to any
Hamiltonian of the spin?

215
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,740
PROFESSOR: Right, U of t is the
thing that essentially moves us

216
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,510
into the rotating frame.

217
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,380
This is the hope that we have.

218
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,965
Any unitary operator, if
it's what evolves your state,

219
00:15:08,965 --> 00:15:10,880
it corresponds to Hamiltonian.

220
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,210
But that's not
anything a priori to do

221
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,890
with our original Hamiltonian.

222
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,540
It's just another Hamiltonian.

223
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:24,150
So you choose your U of t
behind some Hamiltonian.

224
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,930
But what you learn is
that the Hamiltonian

225
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:30,200
for your new system, or
for the new wave function,

226
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,136
will involve that
other Hamiltonian.

227
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:34,582
Yes?

228
00:15:34,582 --> 00:15:36,992
AUDIENCE: HR equals [INAUDIBLE]?

229
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,250
PROFESSOR: This is-- yeah.

230
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,500
It's HU.

231
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,130
I think you are probably right.

232
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,920
I should call it
just HU for-- yeah,

233
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,590
it's a bad idea to call it HR.

234
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,410
U, HU, much better-- thank you.

235
00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:01,220
Here, HR is the Hamiltonian
associated to the Schrodinger

236
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,410
equation here.

237
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,420
So the claim behind
this calculation

238
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:12,320
is that if you calculated
ih bar d dt of psi R of t,

239
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:19,030
you would find HR psi R of t.

240
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,015
So that's the
calculation I think

241
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:23,760
we did last time
in which we just

242
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,480
calculated these derivatives.

243
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,000
And you find this answer.

244
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,590
OK, so let's continue
here and see what happens.

245
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:39,040
Well, I have an Sz and a Sz
similarity transformation here.

246
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,390
But here is Sz.

247
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,835
So that Sz doesn't care.

248
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:45,900
And it can just go out.

249
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,080
So what do we have?

250
00:16:47,080 --> 00:17:01,130
We have omega minus gamma
B0 Sz hat like that.

251
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,500
Then, the rest would be what?

252
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,400
I can take out the
numbers gamma, the B1.

253
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,790
And then, I have this
exponential-- e to the minus i

254
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:19,040
omega t Sz hat over h bar.

255
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:27,760
I'm just having here cosine
omega tSx hat minus sine omega

256
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:36,210
tSy hat, e to the i
omega tSz hat over h bar.

257
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:49,810
OK, now there's two
ways to do this.

258
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,640
You have an exponential here
and another exponential.

259
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,690
This is the kind of thing
you've done quite a few times

260
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,870
in different ways.

261
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:03,190
You could expand exponentials
and just multiply.

262
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:09,150
Or you can sort of do this
usual formula of e to the AB e

263
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,850
to the minus A for this
term and for this term,

264
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,670
and simplify, and
do many things.

265
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,270
So let's do something different.

266
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,830
When one looks at
this, one could say,

267
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,550
well, here's my problem.

268
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,940
HR-- I know U of t.

269
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,380
I fixed it.

270
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:37,150
So knowing psi is knowing
psi R. But to know psi R,

271
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,580
I need to know HR.

272
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,620
And HR still looks
very complicated

273
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,460
unless somehow this whole
idea has worked out very well

274
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,630
and this simplifies.

275
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,610
And the hope is
that it simplifies.

276
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,230
Because in the rotating
frame, the field

277
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,380
is not rotating anymore.

278
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:05,800
So I'll call this M of t.

279
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,050
And I think one
way of doing this,

280
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,810
doing something,
if you're in a rush

281
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,940
and you don't have a formula
sheet or any of those things,

282
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,080
is to just take its derivative,
its time derivative.

283
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,270
Now, if you have a
function of time,

284
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,990
and you don't know what it
is, take its time derivative.

285
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,500
And maybe you'll see a
differential equation

286
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,990
or see something.

287
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:38,220
So let's take the
d dt of M of t.

288
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,040
OK, so what do we get?

289
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,860
Well, we get the
following-- e to the minus

290
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,210
i omega tSz over h bar.

291
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:53,860
And I'll put the big
parentheses here.

292
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,280
OK, here I have an object.

293
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,160
This is something I
think you are familiar.

294
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,830
You've been computing these
things for coherence state,

295
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,010
for squeeze state,
and for all that.

296
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,150
So this will certainly
sound familiar.

297
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,200
If you take a time derivative
of this exponential,

298
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,320
it will bring an operator down.

299
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,610
When you take the time
derivative of this operator,

300
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:22,420
it will bring the operator
down but with a different sign.

301
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,660
And therefore, it will
form the commutator

302
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,220
with the thing like
this in the middle.

303
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:32,540
So the first thing in this
thing is the commutator

304
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:39,240
of-- you take the time
derivative of this-- minus i

305
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:49,650
omega Sz hat over h bar
with the rest of this thing,

306
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:57,320
with cosine omega tSx
minus sine omega tSy.

307
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:07,330
Because the first derivative
brings down the minus i omega

308
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,410
this over that.

309
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,205
So I'll actually take the
minus i omega over h bar out.

310
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,300
OK, that's the
first term that you

311
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,330
get from differentiating
this and that.

312
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,520
And then, you have
to differentiate

313
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,510
the term in the middle.

314
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:39,060
So then, you get minus
omega sine omega tSx

315
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:48,500
hat minus omega
cosine omega tSy hat.

316
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,340
And now, we can close
the big parentheses

317
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:56,010
and put the other
exponential like that.

318
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:14,880
OK, so let's see this.

319
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:22,540
Sz with Sx is ih bar Sy.

320
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:31,020
So you get here minus i
omega over h bar, ih bar Sy

321
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,900
cosine omega t.

322
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,840
Because Sz with Sx-- you
should remember that I think.

323
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,470
Otherwise, you'll waste
time. x, y, and z,

324
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,660
when you have Sz
with Sx, you get Sy.

325
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,850
Sx with Sy, you get a z.

326
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:54,310
And that order helps.

327
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:58,520
So ih bar this, and
then the other term

328
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,040
would be minus sine omega t.

329
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:13,394
But now, Sz with Sy is minus
ih bar, so plus ih bar Sx.

330
00:23:16,572 --> 00:23:18,720
OK, I won't copy the other term.

331
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,150
And let's see if it worked out.

332
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,645
Minus i and i is a plus.

333
00:23:24,645 --> 00:23:30,970
The h bar cancels, so plus
omega Sy cosine omega t

334
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,730
minus omega cosine omega tSy.

335
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:38,110
So this term cancels with this.

336
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:42,330
And this-- there's an ih bar.

337
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:46,780
The sign is the same, so
it's a plus omega sine

338
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,540
Sx minus omega sine.

339
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,510
So these two cancel.

340
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,140
And happily, this
whole thing is 0.

341
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:02,260
So that is the signal
your strategy worked.

342
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:02,760
Why?

343
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,840
Because M of t looks like it
has lots of time dependence.

344
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,300
But in fact, it has none.

345
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,010
Its derivative is 0.

346
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:17,920
So if its derivative is
0, you can evaluate it

347
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,420
at any time you want.

348
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:28,270
Well, the best time to evaluate
it is time equals 0 now.

349
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:32,500
And you put here 0--
disappears, disappears.

350
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,890
This term disappears.

351
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:42,300
The whole thing is just
Sx hat, nothing else.

352
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:48,150
So you may want to do it
the other way by doing

353
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,430
this similarity on
this and on that,

354
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,200
or do it whichever way you want.

355
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,930
But this is good enough.

356
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,960
So we have that this
whole Hamiltonian

357
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,440
has become very simple.

358
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:06,730
So HR has become--
and I'll copy it here,

359
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:17,780
I want to make sure-- minus
gamma B0 plus omega Sz

360
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:25,140
hat minus gamma B1Sx hat.

361
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:30,920
Very nice Hamiltonian--
just two pieces.

362
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,620
The Sz part of the Hamiltonian
that used to be this

363
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,310
got this extra piece
from the rotation.

364
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:42,340
That's our omega Sz.

365
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,280
And this piece over
here is all that

366
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,190
is left of the rotating one.

367
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:51,090
Because in the rotating
frame, the magnetic field

368
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:57,120
is always along the x-axis
as it was at time equals 0.

369
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,490
So it's a perfectly
nice Hamiltonian.

370
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,820
Let's factor a few things.

371
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,410
Let's remember the
notation that omega 0

372
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,180
is [INAUDIBLE] more
frequency associated to B0.

373
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:22,060
So I'll write here, this
is equal to minus gamma B0

374
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:32,410
minus omega over gamma
Sz hat plus B1Sx hat,

375
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:43,160
which is minus gamma B0 1
minus omega over omega 0 Sz

376
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:48,780
hat plus B1Sx hat.

377
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,780
So let me look at
what we've done.

378
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,650
First step, I just factor a
gamma here, so nothing else.

379
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,370
And the same gamma went out.

380
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,330
Next step was to
use this equation,

381
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:08,020
omega 0 equals gamma.
[INAUDIBLE] to eliminate gamma.

382
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,310
So you eliminated gamma by that.

383
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:14,240
So it's equal to
omega 0 over B0.

384
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,780
So the B0 went out.

385
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,100
And you have 1 minus this thing.

386
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,810
And then, you can
think of this HR

387
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:33,220
as minus gamma BR times S. In
the usual notation for spin

388
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:38,420
Hamiltonians, minus
gamma BS, this

389
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:43,780
is the rotating B, the
so-called rotating B.

390
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,550
But of course, it's not
rotating anymore, happily.

391
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:56,320
This is just B0 times 1
minus omega over omega 0 Sz

392
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,100
plus B1Sx.

393
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:10,020
And then, how about our answer?

394
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,260
What is the answer
to this problem?

395
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,940
Well, the answer
is the psi and t.

396
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:33,700
So psi t is U dagger
times psi R of t.

397
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:46,000
And U dagger was e to the i
omega tSz over h bar-- omega t,

398
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,730
yeah.

399
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,480
And what is the other U?

400
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,430
Well, the other U associated
to a time evolution

401
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:59,540
is just e to the
minus iHRt over h bar.

402
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,840
Because HR is time independent.

403
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:09,310
So this equation that tells us
how psi R evolves is with HR.

404
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,970
HR is time independent.

405
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,420
And therefore,
you'll have here e

406
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:23,500
to the minus iHR, which is this.

407
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:37,300
So it becomes plus i gamma
BR dot S over h bar t acting

408
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:42,680
on the state psi
at time equals 0.

409
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,290
You see, the state
psi R at time equals

410
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,860
0 is the same as the
state psi at time

411
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,820
equals 0 because the unitary
operator is the same.

412
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:09,690
So let me box this as well.

413
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:13,740
This is the complete solution
for the problem of the rotating

414
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,800
spins.

415
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,860
So the quantum
mechanical problem

416
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,250
is you've gotten this time
dependent magnetic field.

417
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,270
You want to know
the spin evolution.

418
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,280
Well, the spin evolution
is a little complicated.

419
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,210
It's this whole thing.

420
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:33,460
And let me just make sure
everything is good here.

421
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,790
Perfect.

422
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,380
Fine.

423
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,360
All right.

424
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,080
Questions.

425
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,482
Yes?

426
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:46,150
AUDIENCE: So you have x
hat, so xc hat and xs hat--

427
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,280
AUDIENCE: BR.

428
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,695
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Oh.

429
00:30:48,695 --> 00:30:49,920
I'm sorry.

430
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,253
It should be BR.

431
00:30:52,253 --> 00:30:53,120
I'm sorry.

432
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,930
What is the mistake here?

433
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:55,470
Sorry.

434
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,460
This is terrible.

435
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,320
z hat, x hat.

436
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,748
Thank you.

437
00:31:01,748 --> 00:31:04,522
That's a magnetic field.

438
00:31:04,522 --> 00:31:05,230
Another question.

439
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,452
Yes?

440
00:31:07,452 --> 00:31:09,160
AUDIENCE: This is a
question [INAUDIBLE].

441
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,800
But when we take d
dt of f of t, how

442
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,990
can we take the computation
relation with hu

443
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,918
in that computation?

444
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:24,582
Why is that the Hamiltonian
that we take in the computation?

445
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,082
BARTON ZWIEBACH: I
don't understand.

446
00:31:26,082 --> 00:31:29,120
When we take the tan
derivative of m of t,

447
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,720
here was m of t
from here to here.

448
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,636
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

449
00:31:35,835 --> 00:31:37,501
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Why
is this thing here?

450
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:39,324
AUDIENCE: Yeah, omega sc.

451
00:31:39,324 --> 00:31:40,740
BARTON ZWIEBACH:
It's because when

452
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,300
you take the time
derivative of this--

453
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,960
let me give you a formula
that you should check.

454
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,590
tA minus tA.

455
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:59,560
d dt of this is equal
to e to the tA, A, B,

456
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,150
e to the minus tA.

457
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,370
That's the formula we used.

458
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:14,130
It should be all right.

459
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,910
So we have our time
dependent states,

460
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:23,580
and let's analyze it
and see what it's doing.

461
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,240
Yes?

462
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,820
One more question.

463
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,040
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE] that
we have these magnetic fields,

464
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,546
but somehow, in our
Hamiltonian, it all

465
00:32:34,546 --> 00:32:38,830
boils down to just the spin
operating in the x direction.

466
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,210
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Well, they're
still in the z direction.

467
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,876
AUDIENCE: There's
still the z component,

468
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:45,509
but the time variant components
in the y and x direction--

469
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:47,050
BARTON ZWIEBACH:
Has become something

470
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,518
like in the x direction.

471
00:32:48,518 --> 00:32:49,017
Right.

472
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,056
AUDIENCE: It's hard
to say physically,

473
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:55,986
but what does the system
actually look like?

474
00:32:55,986 --> 00:32:58,360
BARTON ZWIEBACH: That's what
we're going to do right now.

475
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,370
AUDIENCE: All right.

476
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:04,090
BARTON ZWIEBACH: This formula
is very pleasant to look at.

477
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,390
You say, oh, I'm
very accomplished.

478
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,090
I solved it.

479
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,760
But what does that do?

480
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,600
What does that describe?

481
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,260
That's what we have to do now.

482
00:33:16,948 --> 00:33:20,430
And that's the interesting
part, of course.

483
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:26,580
So applications always have
B1 much smaller than B0.

484
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:32,650
This is the longitudinal
component, and that's the case.

485
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,830
Let me describe
for you what this

486
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:43,250
is doing in case one, omega
much smaller than omega 0.

487
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:47,808
You see, given B0,
there is an omega

488
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:52,900
0, the Larmor one over there.

489
00:33:52,900 --> 00:34:00,710
And B0 is very large, so
omega 0 is very large as well.

490
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,010
So omega very slow
is reasonable.

491
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:06,880
The magnetic field is
rotating much smaller

492
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,310
than whatever rotation this
other magnetic field would

493
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,414
create on the things.

494
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:19,580
Moreover, if omega is
much smaller than omega 0,

495
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:36,199
BR is sort of like B0 z
plus B1 x, roughly that.

496
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,760
So what does this do?

497
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,980
Well, this is a magnetic
field mostly along the z-axis.

498
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,980
So here is x, y, z.

499
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,949
This is a magnetic field
that's like this, BR.

500
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:12,260
Now, this BR, let's assume
also for an assumption that

501
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:17,530
at t equals 0, the spin of
whatever spin state you have

502
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:23,690
is up plus z.

503
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:30,370
So what does this magnetic
field do to the spin?

504
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:31,740
Well, you have it here.

505
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:39,800
So this is going
to rotate the spin

506
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,240
states around the axis of BR.

507
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:59,330
The rotation operator here, this
is minus the angular velocity,

508
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:02,100
so there's a minus sign
here that you always

509
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,350
must think about.

510
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,470
But forget about
it for a second.

511
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:10,140
This is rotating
around BR, so this,

512
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,640
supposed to have a spin state
here in the z direction,

513
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,670
is going to start to rotating
in a little cone like that.

514
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,660
It's very close to
the BR, so it's just

515
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,820
going to rotate
around it like that.

516
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,350
And that's what this
part is going to do.

517
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,290
But you say, but that's
not the whole thing.

518
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,170
The whole thing is this as well.

519
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:41,920
Well, intuitively, this
rotation that this produces

520
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,680
a rotation around
the z-axis, but it's

521
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:51,910
much slower than this rotation
because this BR field,

522
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:59,050
its magnitude is
like B0 roughly.

523
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:03,620
Therefore, it produces
a very fast rotation.

524
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,960
So what you must imagine
is this little spin state

525
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,560
generating this cone here
and rotating a million times

526
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,390
a second, but this
whole thing is still

527
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:20,530
being rotated by this
exponential around the z-axis.

528
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,300
So this whole cone,
in some sense,

529
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,500
is precessing around the z-axis.

530
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,870
Now, if you want to
know where the spin is

531
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:35,840
at any instant of time,
you do the following thing.

532
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,350
You say, time equals one second.

533
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:42,340
So you come here
and say, one second,

534
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,400
a billion turns and a quarter.

535
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,720
It ends up here.

536
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:52,000
But in one second, this
rotates it by five degrees,

537
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,240
so then it rotates
a little more.

538
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,730
You could do it that way.

539
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,680
That's a good way
to think about it.

540
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,290
But in the approximation,
which is so fast,

541
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:06,050
basically, this cone has now,
by the second exponential,

542
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,418
been rotated like that.

543
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:14,130
Now let's do the
case that is really

544
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:19,810
the important one, the case,
as you could imagine in which

545
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:26,230
we know some resonance and
omega is set equal to omega 0.

546
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:37,880
So the physicists know what
omega 0 is for the spins,

547
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,140
and then they make the
radio frequency coincide

548
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,810
with that omega 0.

549
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:49,760
In that case, you lose
completely the z component here

550
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,750
of this BR.

551
00:38:53,750 --> 00:39:02,410
So BR is going to be B1 x.

552
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:05,030
And then, here is
what's going to happen.

553
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:14,130
You have a B1 x here, a B1
over here in the x direction.

554
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:18,260
The spin state is sitting
at time equals 0 here.

555
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:25,570
And since normal
exponentials that

556
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:28,890
do time evolutions
have a minus sign here,

557
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:32,910
I claim that instead of
rotating the spin around B1,

558
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,830
it's really rotating
it around minus B1.

559
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:41,650
So the spin will
just go down here.

560
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,838
Rotate, rotate, rotate, rotate.

561
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:57,810
Now, it's rotating with B1,
which is much smaller than B0.

562
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,610
So it's rotating with
an angular frequency

563
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:05,990
that is much smaller than omega
0, but it's rotating down here.

564
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:14,935
And now, what's really
happening is the following.

565
00:40:14,935 --> 00:40:17,590
Let me draw this if I can.

566
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,800
Here it is.

567
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:36,450
The spin is up, and it
begins to go into the y-axis.

568
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,125
Here is z.

569
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:41,940
B1 is turning into the y-axis,
so it rotates a little.

570
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,880
So let me ask you, what is the
second exponential going to do?

571
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,400
It's going to rotate it
further, but this time

572
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,600
around the z-axis.

573
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:58,230
So this one goes down a
little bit in some time,

574
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:01,250
but then this z exponential,
the other exponential,

575
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,580
is going to rotate
it around the z-axis.

576
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,910
So this is going to go
down a little but rotate.

577
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,630
So actually, what's
going to happen

578
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:18,240
is that it's going
to do a spiral.

579
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,615
As it begins to go down,
the other one rotates.

580
00:41:20,615 --> 00:41:23,290
It goes down a little,
the other one rotates it.

581
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:33,830
In fact, this, since B1 is much
smaller than B0 or omega 0,

582
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,890
here now, omega is
equal to omega 0,

583
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:40,930
so this is rotating around
the z direction with omega 0.

584
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:46,910
But B1 is much smaller than B0,
so this rotation is very slow.

585
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:50,730
As it goes down a little,
it's rotating very fast

586
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:56,990
and fills out the spiral
until it gets down here.

587
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:03,880
So that's what the poor
spin is doing in this thing.

588
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,840
It's actually of
interest to time

589
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:15,830
the radio frequency signals,
to time the systems of B1

590
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:19,310
so that you get it
to go into the plane

591
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:23,350
so that the spin is
maximally perpendicular

592
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,430
to the original direction.

593
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:29,365
For that, you
choose omega 1 times

594
00:42:29,365 --> 00:42:35,450
time, which is the Larmor
frequency associated

595
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:40,390
to B1 times time, to
be equal to pi over 2.

596
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:50,110
And omega 1, just like any
omega, is gamma B1 pi over 2.

597
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:56,160
So t is pi over 2 gamma B1.

598
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,890
It's called the half
pulse, something like that.

599
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:08,380
No, a 90 degree pulse.

600
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,330
That's a normal name for it.

601
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:13,810
So if you keep the
radio frequency

602
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:19,880
on for this much time, then the
spin, at the end of the day,

603
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:26,250
it got to the equator of the
sphere, and B1 has disappeared.

604
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:29,710
So B1 is gone, BR
is gone, and then

605
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,475
it keeps rotating because there
is the other magnetic field

606
00:43:33,475 --> 00:43:38,010
still, the longitudinal
magnetic field.

607
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:40,750
One exercise that you
still have in the homework

608
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:45,770
is to figure out the equation
of the spiral that comes out

609
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:46,430
of here.

610
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:50,160
You will find it
sounds complicated,

611
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,690
but it's a couple of lines.

612
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:54,010
It's very simple,
actually, to do it,

613
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:56,840
after you think about
it for a second.

614
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,790
That's one thing
you'll have to do.

615
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:04,740
So this, in fact, is basically
the solution of the problem,

616
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,260
and let's just talk
for a few minutes

617
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,140
about what it's used for.

618
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,500
So this is basically
the technique

619
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:20,766
that is exactly used for
Magnetic Resonance Imaging,

620
00:44:20,766 --> 00:44:21,265
MRIs.

621
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:28,340
If you have to say one of
the interesting applications

622
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,490
of quantum mechanics
to technology,

623
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:35,910
MRIs, Magnetic
Resonance Imaging,

624
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,650
is one of the great ones.

625
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:42,930
So how does it work?

626
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,830
Well, it's a very useful device.

627
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:50,540
In fact, it
revolutionized medicine

628
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:54,130
because it goes much beyond
what you can do with x-rays.

629
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,660
It's very popular.

630
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:59,790
I imagine a good fraction
of you have had an MRI.

631
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:00,360
Let's see.

632
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,160
How many people have had
an MRI in their lives?

633
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:09,800
We're pretty much, I
think, 60% of people here.

634
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,130
So you remember getting
into this cavity?

635
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:16,140
Well, you've experienced
there a large--

636
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,830
if you worry about
cell phone radiation,

637
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:22,790
well, there, you
were with two Tesla,

638
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:27,350
20,000 Gauss, a big, big magnet.

639
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:33,210
It's big enough that it has to
be cooled with liquid helium

640
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:37,310
at 3 degrees Kelvin
so you can get

641
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:41,810
the currents big enough and
the magnetic field big enough.

642
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:51,980
So they put you into this
cylinder, a solenoid,

643
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:52,855
and there you go.

644
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,840
And it's not
dangerous unless you

645
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:06,200
forget some metal or
some device like that.

646
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,710
In fact, it says in
WebMD that if you

647
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:15,030
have some sort of tattoos,
they used iron ink,

648
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:20,550
it can burn your skin or you
could have some problems.

649
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:22,520
Anyway, if you're
claustrophobic,

650
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:26,240
may have MRIs that are
open air, but they're

651
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,500
less powerful, less
strong magnetic field.

652
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:33,380
So this is two Tesla, roughly.

653
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:39,350
And so what happens
is that basically,

654
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:41,910
this thing just is
trying to figure out

655
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:44,480
the local
concentration of water.

656
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,800
It begins like that.

657
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,530
The magnetic fields react with
the hydrogen atoms, in fact,

658
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:54,590
with the protons inside there.

659
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:58,310
Each proton has a
magnetic dipole moment.

660
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:04,310
It gets roughly aligned to the
magnetic field, to this B0.

661
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,730
So the protons get
aligned to the B0

662
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,890
that is going in here, B0.

663
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:21,630
So the proton spin is up there.

664
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,500
In fact, because of
temperature, not all

665
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,040
of your protons in
your body get aligned.

666
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:32,015
Maybe one in a million does,
but that's high enough.

667
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:36,400
And then they send
this 90 degree pulse.

668
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,300
So this thing starts
spiraling, and then

669
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,840
it finally goes
into this direction

670
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,440
and it rotates,
rotates like crazy.

671
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:51,410
Then, as it rotates like
crazy, a rotating dipole moment

672
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,420
is like a generator of
electromagnetic waves.

673
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:57,400
So it generates an
electromagnetic wave,

674
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:03,740
and there are detectors all
over that pick up this signal.

675
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:07,230
The strength of that
signal is proportional

676
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:10,510
to the concentration of water.

677
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:14,480
So it gives you an
idea, not to distinguish

678
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:20,935
solid matter versus soft matter,
but all kinds of liquids.

679
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,860
So it's very, very useful.

680
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:30,480
You pick a signal over here
and you get it from a receiver,

681
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,070
and it tells you about the
local concentration of water.

682
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:38,560
And therefore, it allows you to
distinguish different tissues.

683
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,160
Some tissues have lots of water,
some tissues have less water,

684
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,535
so it begins to distinguish
different tissues.

685
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,480
Now, there's two more
things that people do.

686
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:58,270
This pin is rotating very fast,
but there's a relaxation time.

687
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:02,910
After it rotates
for a while, there's

688
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:12,170
a time, T2, is relaxation
of this rotation.

689
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:13,990
Relaxation time.

690
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:16,600
And then there's
another time, T1,

691
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,610
which is the time after
this is turned off

692
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:25,180
that it takes the
spin to go back

693
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,810
again to the original position.

694
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:33,480
So two times, the
relaxation time

695
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,340
in which you lose
your rotation here

696
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:40,380
because it's interacting
with other spins.

697
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,850
It's called spin,
spin, relaxation.

698
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:48,180
And then an interaction with a
whole set of neighboring atoms

699
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,740
that brings it
eventually back up

700
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,440
and aligns it to
the magnetic field.

701
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,840
So you measure two
things, T1 and T2,

702
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,260
and those are very
good clues because you

703
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:05,000
can put any liquid
in the machine

704
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,870
and measure its T1 and T2.

705
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:11,430
And then you place a table
of T1's and T2's, and then

706
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:13,720
if you want to figure
out what kind of thing

707
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,550
you have in your
body, they look it up,

708
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,730
and immediately,
they may know what

709
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:20,240
are the possible candidates.

710
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:27,490
In fact, T2 is actually
enough to distinguish

711
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:31,550
white matter, gray matter,
and fluids in your brain.

712
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:34,940
Totally different T2's.

713
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:41,640
T1 is helpful to discuss
all kinds of things as well.

714
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,760
So basically, people have
figured out how to do that.

715
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,570
Finally, one last thing.

716
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:51,450
When you go into the machine,
it sometimes makes noises.

717
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:53,040
Big noises.

718
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,530
And those are gradient
magnets that are being moved.

719
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:01,320
You see, basically, if this
thing would be like that,

720
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,940
you would pick up
a signal and you

721
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,420
wouldn't know where
it comes from.

722
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,690
So what these
people do now-- this

723
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,740
has gotten extremely
sophisticated.

724
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:15,890
They put a gradient magnet which
changes the value of B0 locally

725
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:17,550
by increasing it.

726
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:20,540
For example, the B0 is
not really constant in z,

727
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,270
but it changes.

728
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:28,390
So the omega 0 of rotation
of the spins changes as well.

729
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:32,650
So with a sufficiently high
gradient of magnetic field,

730
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,660
they can have
spatial resolution.

731
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,370
If they pick a signal a
little bit higher frequency,

732
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:40,550
they know it's a little
bit higher up in your body.

733
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:43,470
So they get resolutions
with these magnets

734
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:46,390
of about how much?

735
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:48,350
Very high resolutions.

736
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:51,290
Half a millimeter.

737
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:56,780
So at the end of the day,
it's a great machine,

738
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,980
and lots of mathematics
in reconstructing images,

739
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:05,480
lots of computation, lots
of experimental analysis

740
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,530
of constants, much of
it phenomenological.

741
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:11,930
It would be hard to
predict those constants,

742
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,260
but you can measure them.

743
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:19,090
So it's very, very
practical and very nice.

744
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:26,040
So it's a nice application,
and we'll leave it at that.

745
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,370
Are there any questions?

746
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:32,840
Not that I know much
more about that.

747
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,745
But it's a junior lab
experiment as well.

748
00:52:36,745 --> 00:52:40,520
So I believe the calculation
is fairly straightforward

749
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,980
and the technology
is just amazing.

750
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,010
It's great.

751
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:45,110
Yes?

752
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,200
AUDIENCE: So about
getting your spin back up

753
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,550
along the z direction,
is that mechanism

754
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:52,079
the same as when you
relax [INAUDIBLE]?

755
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,620
BARTON ZWIEBACH:
When you relax what?

756
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:57,370
AUDIENCE: So is the mechanism
for getting your spin back

757
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:59,620
along the z
direction to find T1,

758
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:02,062
is that the same
mechanism as when

759
00:53:02,062 --> 00:53:04,970
you do all of this [INAUDIBLE]?

760
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:06,130
BARTON ZWIEBACH: No.

761
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:08,670
It's sort of a
different mechanism.

762
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:09,930
We don't analyze it.

763
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:17,040
It's not being driven by
Schrodinger time evolution.

764
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,510
All these relaxations are
more complicated phenomena.

765
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:23,380
In fact, if you maintain
the magnetic field,

766
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,270
this is supposed to go
on forever and never stop

767
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:27,180
rotating.

768
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,700
But due to interactions
with other things,

769
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:34,400
it's sort of stops
rotating at some stage,

770
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,070
and then eventually, many
of them also go back up.

771
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:41,170
So these are not easily
calculable things

772
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:42,700
within our analysis.

773
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:45,970
These are
phenomenological constants

774
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:52,310
that need to be measured
or done by experiment.

775
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:56,890
So last part of today's lecture
is multi-particle states

776
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:59,520
and tensor products.

777
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,980
Let's get on with that.

778
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:07,600
Let's see we have there.

779
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:17,230
So multi-particle states
and tensor products.

780
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:31,440
The idea is the following.

781
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,980
You have a system with
more than one particle.

782
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,660
Let's talk two particles.

783
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:40,030
It won't matter at this
moment whether they're

784
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:41,980
distinguishable,
not distinguishable.

785
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,810
Those are things
that come later,

786
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:48,320
and we will probably not discuss
much of that in this semester.

787
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,880
This will be more in 806.

788
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,110
But let's consider if
we have particle one,

789
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:58,100
and we'll keep the
possibility that this

790
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,230
is completely
distinguishable, in fact.

791
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:03,010
Particle one.

792
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:08,810
Its quantum mechanics is
described by a complex vector

793
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:22,165
space, v. And you have
some operators, T1, T2.

794
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:31,850
Particle two,
complex vector space,

795
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:42,300
w, and the operators,
S1, S2, all that.

796
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,340
You see, the list of
operators is something

797
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,050
that you are already
familiar with.

798
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:52,930
Quantum mechanics operators
can include momentum, position,

799
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:57,380
if it's three dimensional,
three positions, three momenta,

800
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:04,560
angular momentum, spin,
Hamiltonians, all those things,

801
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,860
and those exist
for both particles.

802
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:13,130
So the question is, how do we
describe the composite system,

803
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:17,200
the system of the
two particles that

804
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,720
exist at the same time, that
possibly could interact even

805
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,780
with each other?

806
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:27,570
So we need a description
of these two things.

807
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:32,710
Well, a description
of particle one

808
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:37,145
is described by some vector,
v, in the vector space.

809
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:45,350
Description of particle two is
some state, some vector omega,

810
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:49,330
in the vector space w.

811
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:55,820
So we imagine that
it's a reasonable thing

812
00:56:55,820 --> 00:57:00,200
to give you those two
vectors and say, look,

813
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,360
that's what particle
one is doing,

814
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:06,370
that's what particle two is
doing, and that is correct.

815
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:09,330
It's a bit more subtle than
that, as we'll see now,

816
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:17,360
but we could list v
and list w, and this

817
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:25,345
is the information
about each particle.

818
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:38,690
And this is, in some ways,
too naive, as we will see.

819
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:44,400
It has the right idea, but
the amazing possibilities

820
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,280
that can take place when
you have these two particles

821
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:53,340
are not quite reflected
on that thing yet.

822
00:57:53,340 --> 00:58:04,620
So to make this idea clearer,
we'll use a notation.

823
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:10,650
So I will say that I
will encode these things

824
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:21,940
and I will write them
as v tensor product w.

825
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:30,640
It's reflecting that we're going
to do something more than just

826
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,920
view this as the possibility.

827
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,670
You have a system.

828
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:35,510
You know what the
particle one is doing,

829
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:38,830
you know what the second
particle is doing.

830
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:41,890
List those two, that's
all that can happen.

831
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:43,840
Not quite true.

832
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:48,630
So let's put it like that, and
this will be the information.

833
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,680
BARTON ZWIEBACH:
I'm not multiplying

834
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,870
this in any obvious way.

835
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:55,270
It's not that I'm supposed
to multiply and do

836
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:56,910
a calculation here.

837
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:59,030
I'm just putting the
two pieces of data

838
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:02,630
but putting this
curly ball here as

839
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:05,570
to say that it's
the two together,

840
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:09,810
and we'll have some ways of
dealing with this object.

841
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:16,760
And this will be
said to be an element

842
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:28,526
of a new, complex vector
space, v tensor w.

843
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:48,550
So what we are saying here,
with v belonging to v and w

844
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:54,560
belonging to w, this
thing belongs to v plus w.

845
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,440
Tensor product of
the vector spaces.

846
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:08,270
At this moment, this
is a little funny,

847
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:16,130
but let me ask you
some things about it.

848
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:21,734
We have v w.

849
01:00:21,734 --> 01:00:24,850
So this is an element
of that space.

850
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:27,300
I put a vector of the
first vector space here

851
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,880
and I put a vector of
the second vector space,

852
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,440
and this will be a vector here.

853
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,090
I'm not saying it's the
most general vector there,

854
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:39,690
or how we operate with them,
but it's a vector there.

855
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:43,000
Now, you say, look,
when I had states,

856
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,350
you had states plus minus, you
put constants in front of them.

857
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:54,825
So I'll put a constant in
front of this v, alpha.

858
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:08,710
Well, is this something related?

859
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:13,370
We had this vector that was a
vector in the tensor product.

860
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:16,050
How is this vector
related to this vector?

861
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:37,060
Well, unless you declare that
these things are somewhat

862
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:41,520
related, this object is
going to be very, very large

863
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,940
because if this vector has
nothing to do with this,

864
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,800
this is going to be
yet another vector

865
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,610
linearly independent with this.

866
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:52,820
So it's, again, your choice
what you're going to declare.

867
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:56,480
If you will be constructing
what is called a direct product,

868
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,280
not a tensor product,
and that's apologies

869
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:04,400
to [? Shanker. ?] He uses the
word "direct products" wrong

870
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,380
mathematically.

871
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:08,690
Mathematicians don't call
this a direct product.

872
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,470
Direct product is
something in which

873
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:12,930
this has nothing
to do with this.

874
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:16,340
But in physics, you're
thinking of the amplitude

875
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:20,470
to have a first particle
doing that, and suddenly,

876
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:24,280
that amplitude becomes twice
as big and this other one

877
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,010
doesn't change.

878
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:26,870
Well, the amplitude
defining this one here

879
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:29,850
and that one there has
become twice as big

880
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:32,930
just because this one is
twice more likely to be here

881
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:34,250
and that's the same.

882
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:38,230
So we're going to say that
this is the same as that.

883
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:42,460
The alpha can go out
and it's the same thing,

884
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:47,740
and it's also the same
thing as v tensor alpha w.

885
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,390
So numbers go out,
and they don't go out

886
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:57,270
with a complex conjugate.

887
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:59,345
They go out just like that.

888
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,760
So that's one thing
we declare that

889
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,770
will happen with these
things, and that's

890
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:11,010
a property that we impose.

891
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:13,990
It's what is usually
understood to take place

892
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,050
in tensor products.

893
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:27,580
Now, if this is a
vector in this space,

894
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:37,260
then if, for example,
v1 is a vector

895
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:43,650
and v2 cross w2 is a
vector in v cross w,

896
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:47,250
then this is supposed to
be a linear vector space.

897
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:59,610
So it should be true that alpha
v1 omega 1 plus beta v2 omega 2

898
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:03,520
also belongs to
this vector space.

899
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:08,430
And suddenly, you see why
this was a little too naive.

900
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:11,810
If you tell me, this is
what particle one is doing

901
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:14,770
and this is what particle
is doing, end of story,

902
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:18,010
this list, well,
quantum mechanics

903
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:21,430
seems to say that there's
more interesting possibilities

904
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:25,280
in which the state is
a superposition now

905
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,020
in which first particle
is doing this, which

906
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:31,450
may be a superposition
itself, and this one

907
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:36,090
is doing this, plus first
particle is doing that

908
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:39,510
and second particle
is doing that.

909
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:42,940
So it's not enough to say to
the state of two particles,

910
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:46,280
say, you just need to
know the state of one,

911
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,190
state of the other,
list the two.

912
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:51,895
That is a possible
state of the system,

913
01:04:51,895 --> 01:04:54,180
but it's not the most general.

914
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:56,520
The most general
is a superposition

915
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,750
in which particle
one does something,

916
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:02,340
particle two does something,
plus another possibility,

917
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:04,500
particle one is
doing something else,

918
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,240
particle two is
doing another thing.

919
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:14,180
This is the origin of this
famous idea of entanglement,

920
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:16,490
as we will see you next time.

921
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:19,120
But let's just continue here.

922
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:23,020
These particles,
roughly speaking,

923
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:26,110
seem to be entangled,
in which you

924
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:29,660
can't say what particle one
is doing without knowing what

925
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:32,155
particle two is doing
and things like that.

926
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:41,330
So something new has happened
by taking this idea slowly

927
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:43,360
and figuring out
what's going on,

928
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:47,600
but we need yet one
more thing to cut down

929
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,610
this tensor product.

930
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:51,650
This tensor product is
still a little bigger

931
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:57,920
than what you may want it to
be in the following sense.

932
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,310
Suppose you have
v1 plus v2, which

933
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:06,875
is another vector,
tensor w, another vector.

934
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:12,330
Unless you tell
me what this is, I

935
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:22,420
don't know that this is
actually v1 plus v2 unless you

936
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:23,520
declare it.

937
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,150
This is just another
vector here and that.

938
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:30,810
Why should that
be equal to this?

939
01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:34,520
Well, it's the way you feel
about quantum mechanics.

940
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:37,660
That's how you should think
of the composite system.

941
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,970
If the first state can be
either of two possibilities

942
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:43,690
while the other one
is not, well it's

943
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:52,500
a superposition in which, yes,
the first state is doing this

944
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,410
and the first state
is doing something

945
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:57,340
different with the
second doing the same.

946
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:02,680
So this is part of also an
axiom of the tensor product.

947
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,510
Whenever you have
tensor products,

948
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:07,170
you will simplify in that way.

949
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:10,430
It looks almost trivial,
but it's certainly

950
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:12,410
something that has to be stated.

951
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:16,190
If you had a direct product,
you form a vector space

952
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:19,540
by just putting first
vector, second vector,

953
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,260
and you don't explain anything.

954
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:23,210
This would not be true.

955
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:36,740
So similarly, we'll also have v1
w1 plus w2 equals v1 w1 plus v1

956
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,320
w2.

957
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:44,910
So these are our
last operations.

958
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:49,190
So with these two
operations, we've

959
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:55,390
defined completely how to
calculate with this two

960
01:07:55,390 --> 01:08:01,920
particle Hilbert space, and
how to define the states.

961
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:09,170
Let me add some intuition to
this by stating the following.

962
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:16,390
So what is this
space, v tensor w,

963
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:19,944
is the space spanned
by things like this.

964
01:08:23,779 --> 01:08:29,560
So with these rules,
here comes the thing

965
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:33,319
that puts it all, in
a sense, together.

966
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:55,819
If e1 up to en is a basis
for v, and f1 up to fm

967
01:08:55,819 --> 01:09:09,399
is a basis for w, this set
of things, ei tensor fj,

968
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:11,649
and how many of them are there?

969
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:15,500
There are n of this
and m of those.

970
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:23,270
This for i from 1 up
to n, j from 1 up to m,

971
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:31,594
form a basis for v tensor w.

972
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:39,880
So basically, if you have a
four dimensional vector space

973
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:43,646
v and a 10 dimensional
vector space w,

974
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:47,490
v cross w is 40 dimensional.

975
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:50,240
You multiply the dimensions.

976
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,310
You don't sum them.

977
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:56,810
In the tensor product,
the dimensions multiply.

978
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:59,290
You see, the elements
of this tensor product

979
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:01,760
was one vector here,
one vector there.

980
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,740
So it behooves you that you
would expect that, well, you

981
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:09,480
can get all vectors that can
sit here with all the ei's, all

982
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,510
the vectors here,
but only if you

983
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:15,520
have these rules of
superposition and linearity.

984
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:20,350
So this is the whole
basis of the vector space.

985
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:27,240
And dimension of
v cross w would be

986
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:33,210
equal to the dimension of
v times the dimension of w.

987
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,390
Questions?

988
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:45,194
Yes?

989
01:10:45,194 --> 01:10:48,644
AUDIENCE: So for the
first box thing up there,

990
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:53,711
so v and w are two
different vector spaces.

991
01:10:53,711 --> 01:10:56,169
Let's say that they're vector
spaces over different fields.

992
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:57,111
How do you know that--

993
01:10:57,111 --> 01:10:57,590
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Oh no.

994
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:58,465
Different fields, no.

995
01:10:58,465 --> 01:11:00,390
Both are over complex numbers.

996
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:01,376
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

997
01:11:01,376 --> 01:11:03,629
They're both complex.

998
01:11:03,629 --> 01:11:05,920
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Both spaces
are complex vector spaces.

999
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,110
Did I say it?

1000
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:09,830
Complex vector space,
complex vector space.

1001
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:20,460
Then v cross w is an element
of a new complex vector space.

1002
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:22,380
So yes, everybody's
complex here.

1003
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:31,740
Let me continue a
little more because we

1004
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:34,400
need to get a little further.

1005
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,930
I would like to get a
little further here today.

1006
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:41,020
We still have about 10 minutes.

1007
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:44,630
These are really,
in some ways simple

1008
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:47,870
but in some ways
very subtle ideas.

1009
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:49,080
I hope you appreciate it.

1010
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,040
At some moments, you
think, this is obvious.

1011
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,030
It's ridiculous.

1012
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:53,820
It's taking too
long to explain it.

1013
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:57,790
At some point, you step back
and say, I'm now confused.

1014
01:11:57,790 --> 01:12:00,630
What does that mean?

1015
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:03,800
It is subtle.

1016
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,170
So let's see now what happens.

1017
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:13,430
We need to do
operators on v cross w.

1018
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:22,450
So suppose T is an operator in
v, and s is an operator in w.

1019
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:29,990
So we call them like that, T
operators and the S operator

1020
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:30,500
on w.

1021
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,730
So here it is.

1022
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:37,500
We define an s
tensor T that will

1023
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:43,970
be an operator on the
tensor product, v cross w.

1024
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:45,720
Let's see how it is.

1025
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:50,120
So if this is an operator
on the tensor product,

1026
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:55,800
it should know how to
act on v any element.

1027
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:59,750
In any basic element or
element of this form,

1028
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,970
since all the elements can
be written as superposition

1029
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:05,660
of these things, if this
is a linear operator

1030
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:09,110
and I define it acting
on this, we've got it.

1031
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:13,120
Now, what I'm going to
write in the right hand side

1032
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,440
is a matter of common sense.

1033
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:20,030
It's a definition, but
it's hardly possible

1034
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:22,890
to have any other definition
than what I'm going to do.

1035
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:31,480
Lights.

1036
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,975
Main screen, window shades.

1037
01:13:38,836 --> 01:13:40,195
Oh, lights here.

1038
01:13:40,195 --> 01:13:42,010
There we go.

1039
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:56,280
Well, you know, I got the
order wrong here, T cross S.

1040
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,970
And the only thing
you could do is

1041
01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:04,458
if T, you know how it acts
on v. Well, let it act on v.

1042
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:10,085
And it will be a vector in
v, and you know how S acts

1043
01:14:10,085 --> 01:14:13,560
on omega, so let
it act on omega,

1044
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:16,630
and that's the definition.

1045
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:21,140
Not that complicated,
really, in a sense.

1046
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:26,840
Each operator acts on its
thing, so you just let it act.

1047
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:32,400
Whoever has to act, acts
wherever it can do it.

1048
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:38,640
And it's linear operator, and
if you act on more things,

1049
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,860
it will be linear.

1050
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:42,620
It will all be fine here.

1051
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:45,310
Now, this is a fine operator.

1052
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:50,050
Now, the operators that are
a little more surprising,

1053
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:53,090
perhaps, at first sight
are the following.

1054
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:09,105
Suppose you have an operator,
T1, that is an operator on v,

1055
01:15:09,105 --> 01:15:13,580
and you want it to act
on the tensor product.

1056
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:16,350
You say, well, I need
another operator.

1057
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:20,070
This acts on v. I need another
operator attached on the tensor

1058
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:26,430
product, but you don't give
me one, so what am I to do?

1059
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:29,850
So this is what is called
upgrading an operator that

1060
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:32,800
acts on one vector space
to an operator that

1061
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,940
acts on the whole thing
because you need everything

1062
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:37,840
to act now on the
tensor product.

1063
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:42,060
So what you do is the following.

1064
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:48,700
You let the operator
become T1 that acts on v,

1065
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:52,740
and you put tensor product
with the identity operator.

1066
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,360
This is more or less
what you would imagine.

1067
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:03,570
You have now an operator that
belongs to the linear operators

1068
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:05,680
on the tensor product,
but it's the operator

1069
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,680
you got times that.

1070
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:14,740
If you had an operator,
S1, belonging to L of w,

1071
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:18,560
it would go into 1 times S1.

1072
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,494
Now I ask you the question,
do these operators commute?

1073
01:16:32,672 --> 01:16:35,450
Strange question, but it's
a fundamental question.

1074
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:39,470
It's really the basis of most
of your intuition about two

1075
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:42,820
particle systems.

1076
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:44,750
Well, let's see if they commute.

1077
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:54,230
You have T1 tensor 1
multiplied by 1 tensor S1.

1078
01:16:54,230 --> 01:16:59,500
It's going to act on v tensor w.

1079
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:08,750
Or you have it in the
other order, 1 S1 T1 1.

1080
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:22,020
Well, when it acts, the first
part, it gives me T1 tensor 1,

1081
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:26,747
but now acting on this,
this is v tensor Sw.

1082
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:31,710
And then when I
act on this one, I

1083
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:39,285
get now T1 on v tensor S1 of w.

1084
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:48,670
And when I act here, the first
step, it gives me a T1 on v,

1085
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:51,310
and the second gives
me the S1 on w,

1086
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:53,090
so it gives me the same thing.

1087
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:57,830
T1 on v, S1 on w.

1088
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:02,680
So these two operators,
because they originated,

1089
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,750
they've operators of the
first particle, operator

1090
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:11,000
of the second particle, they
can act on the whole system,

1091
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,850
but they still commute.

1092
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:15,520
They don't know
about each other,

1093
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,390
and the communication
now is the calculation

1094
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:21,660
which you just have seen.

1095
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:24,350
What this is a good
example of this thing

1096
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:32,120
is that when you try to
write the Hamiltonian

1097
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:36,810
of the whole system, H
total, you would say,

1098
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:40,090
oh, it's the Hamiltonian
of the first system,

1099
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:46,340
tensor 1, plus 1
tensor the Hamiltonian

1100
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:47,590
of the second system.

1101
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:55,880
Time for an example.

1102
01:18:55,880 --> 01:19:03,490
So the example is a famous one,
and this is a great example

1103
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:08,250
because it's at the basis of
combining angular momentum.

1104
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:13,100
So it's an example you're going
to see now and see many times.

1105
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:14,715
Two spin one 1/2 particles.

1106
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:31,130
The first partoc;e has a
state plus and a state minus

1107
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:33,910
for the first article.

1108
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:38,805
The second particle has a
state plus and a state minus.

1109
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:46,050
So how do we form
the tensor product?

1110
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:48,300
Well, we say,
these are our basis

1111
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,340
states for the
first Hilbert space,

1112
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:52,800
the basis states for the
second Hilbert space.

1113
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,920
We're supposed to take
the product state.

1114
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:02,320
So our tensor product is going
to be spanned, so two spins.

1115
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:10,260
The tensor vector
space is spanned

1116
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:18,570
by a vector in the first
times a vector in the second,

1117
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:20,890
the basis vectors.

1118
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:30,770
You could have plus in 1,
minus in 2, minus in 1,

1119
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:38,320
plus in 2, and minus
in 1, minus in 2.

1120
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:45,220
So two spin states form a
four-dimensional complex vector

1121
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:47,940
space.

1122
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:52,120
That's how you describe them,
with those little products.

1123
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:55,310
And the most general
state is the following.

1124
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:10,900
Most general state
is a psi, which

1125
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:21,340
is alpha plus plus-- you could
put 1 and 2-- plus here's alpha

1126
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:33,172
1, alpha 2, plus, minus,
plus alpha 3 minus, plus,

1127
01:21:33,172 --> 01:21:37,920
plus alpha 4 minus, minus.

1128
01:21:45,850 --> 01:21:51,340
Let's do just one simple
computation, be done for today.

1129
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:57,130
I want you to try
to figure out what

1130
01:21:57,130 --> 01:22:04,130
is the result of acting with
a total z component of angular

1131
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:10,190
momentum on this state,
whatever that means.

1132
01:22:10,190 --> 01:22:13,910
Total z component
of angular momentum.

1133
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:18,810
So naively speaking, the total
z component of angular momentum

1134
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:21,350
would be the z component
of angular momentum

1135
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:25,910
of the first particle plus
the z component of the angular

1136
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:27,850
momentum of the second
particle, but you

1137
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:30,400
know that's not the
way we should write it.

1138
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,915
So how is it really?

1139
01:22:31,915 --> 01:22:40,270
It should be Sz of the first
particle tensor product with 1

1140
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:46,280
plus 1 tensor product with
Sz of the second particle.

1141
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:48,536
You can say 2 or 1 here.

1142
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:53,230
This is really what it is.

1143
01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:57,740
You see, how do we upgrade an
operator in the first Hilbert

1144
01:22:57,740 --> 01:23:00,380
space to an operator
on the tensor product?

1145
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:02,810
You just let it act
on the first state

1146
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:05,070
but do nothing on the second.

1147
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:09,590
So summing the two
angular momenta really

1148
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:16,120
means constructing this new
operator in the new, larger,

1149
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:22,650
more extended space in
which it acts in this way.

1150
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:27,720
So let's just calculate what
that is and we'll stop there.

1151
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:39,150
Let's see.

1152
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:45,350
For example, we'll have
the first term, Sz 1

1153
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:52,630
tensor 1 acting on psi
on the whole state.

1154
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:57,400
Well, it acts on the
first term, alpha 1.

1155
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:02,680
Now, this operator is
supposed to act on this thing,

1156
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:06,710
so this acts on that
and that acts on that.

1157
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:09,450
So you get-- I'll write
this whole thing-- Sz

1158
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:16,280
hat on plus tensor plus
for the first term.

1159
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:20,100
This term just acted on that.

1160
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:22,470
We can act with
the second one now.

1161
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:27,010
Well, I was putting the first,
so let me leave the first.

1162
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:30,370
Let's do the second
term, plus alpha 2.

1163
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:35,520
It still acts on the first
only, Sz hat plus tensor

1164
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:46,230
minus plus alpha 2 Sz hat on
minus tensor plus, plus alpha

1165
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:53,030
4 Sz hat on minus tensor minus.

1166
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:54,650
Now, what is this?

1167
01:24:54,650 --> 01:25:00,530
Well, this thing is h
bar over 2 times plus,

1168
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:03,200
and the number, of course,
goes out of the tensor product.

1169
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,630
You don't worry about that.

1170
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:07,340
There's h bar over 2 everywhere.

1171
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:10,250
Alpha 1 plus, plus.

1172
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:20,750
Here the same, another plus,
so plus alpha 2 plus, minus.

1173
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:26,350
And here is minus, so
minus alpha 3 minus,

1174
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:32,075
plus, minus alpha 4,
also minus, minus, minus.

1175
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:37,530
So that's what it is.

1176
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:44,440
If I do the other one, you
could do it with me now quickly.

1177
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:49,650
1 tensor Sz 2 on psi.

1178
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:53,050
Once you get accustomed,
these are pretty direct.

1179
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:56,620
So I have to act with
Sz hat on these ones,

1180
01:25:56,620 --> 01:26:00,780
so I just act on the second
one, on the second state.

1181
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:03,860
So I get h bar over 2.

1182
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:05,970
For the first one,
you get a plus,

1183
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:07,790
because it's acting
on this thing,

1184
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:13,110
so you get alpha 1 plus, plus.

1185
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:16,030
For the second one,
however, you get a minus

1186
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:19,200
because it's the second
operator, so minus alpha

1187
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,710
2 plus, minus.

1188
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:26,110
For the third one,
it's a plus, so you

1189
01:26:26,110 --> 01:26:32,160
get a plus alpha 3 minus, plus.

1190
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:35,230
And for the last
one, it's a minus,

1191
01:26:35,230 --> 01:26:42,540
so you get minus
alpha 4 minus, minus.

1192
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:45,710
So when you add them
together, these two pieces,

1193
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:52,290
it's the total, Sz total,
acting on the state,

1194
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,480
and what did you get?

1195
01:26:53,480 --> 01:27:03,360
You get h bar, this one's
at, alpha plus, plus alpha 1.

1196
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,010
These two cancel,
these two cancel.

1197
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:13,680
Minus alpha 4 minus, minus.

1198
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:20,120
That's the whole action
of Sz on this thing.

1199
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:32,100
And if you wanted to have a
state with total Sz equals 0,

1200
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:36,330
then you would have to put
alpha 1 and alpha 4 to 0.

1201
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:44,050
You will, if you
want, at some stage,

1202
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:49,510
calculate, maybe in recitation,
how much is Sy at this state

1203
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:53,080
and how much is
Sx at this state,

1204
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:55,370
and try to figure
out if there is

1205
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:59,510
a state whose total spin
angular momentum is 0.

1206
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:02,530
It's just a
calculation like this.

1207
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:06,080
So next week, we'll
continue with this

1208
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:11,490
and with teleportation
and Bell inequalities.
