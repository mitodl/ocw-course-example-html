8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,860
PROFESSOR: Last time we
spoke about the Stern-Gerlach

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,840
experiment, and how you
could have a sequence

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,800
of Stern-Gerlach boxes that
allow you to understand

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,050
the type of states and
properties of the physics

12
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,750
having to do with spin-1/2.

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,740
So the key thing in the
Stern-Gerlach machine

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:57,130
was that a beam of silver
atoms, each of which

15
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,880
is really like an electron
with a magnetic moment,

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,870
was placed in an inhomogeneous
strong magnetic field,

17
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,820
and that would classically mean
that you would get a deflection

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,750
proportional to the z-component
of the magnetic moment.

19
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,100
What was a surprise
was that by the time

20
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,670
you put the screen
on the right side,

21
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,430
it really split into
two different beams,

22
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,260
as if the magnetic
moments could either

23
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,110
be all the way pointing in
the z-direction or all the way

24
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,910
down, pointing opposite
to the z-direction,

25
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,660
and nothing in between.

26
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,190
A very surprising result.

27
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:45,590
So after looking at
a few of those boxes,

28
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:52,680
we decided that we would try
to model the spin-1/2 particle

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,880
as a two-dimensional
complex vector space.

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,090
What is the two-dimensional
complex vector space?

31
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:07,980
It's the possible space of
states of a spin-1/2 particle.

32
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,980
So our task today to go
into detail into that,

33
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,460
and set up the whole
machinery of spin-1/2.

34
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,300
So we will do so, even though
we haven't quite yet discussed

35
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,090
all the important
concepts of linear algebra

36
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,800
that we're going to need.

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,000
So today, I'm going to
assume that at least you

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,050
have some vague notions
of linear algebra

39
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,740
reasonably well understood.

40
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,340
And if you don't, well,
take them on faith today.

41
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,150
We're going to go
through them slowly

42
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,650
in the next couple
of lectures, and then

43
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,870
as you will reread
this material,

44
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,410
it will make more sense.

45
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,140
So what did we have?

46
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,300
We said that the spin states,
or the possible states

47
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,860
of this silver atom, that really
correspond to an election,

48
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:25,340
could be described by states z
comma plus and z colon minus So

49
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,950
these are the two states.

50
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:34,620
This state we say corresponds
to an angular momentum Sz hat.

51
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,460
Sz-- I can put it like
that-- of h-bar over 2,

52
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:50,000
and this corresponds to Sz
equals minus h-bar over 2.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,100
And those are our two states.

54
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:00,290
The z label indicates that
we've passed, presumably,

55
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,150
these atoms through a
filter in the z-direction,

56
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,380
so that we know
for certain we're

57
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,410
talking about the z-component of
angular momentum of this state.

58
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,540
It is positive, and
the values here again

59
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,250
have the label z to remind us
that we're talking about states

60
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,660
that have been organized using
the z-component of angular

61
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,160
momentum.

62
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,160
You could ask whether this state
has some angular momentum--

63
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,700
spin angular momentum--
in the x-direction

64
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,540
or in the y-direction,
and we will

65
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,530
be able to answer that
question in an hour from now.

66
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:49,960
So mathematically, we say
that this statement, that

67
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,730
this state, has Sz
equals h-bar over 2

68
00:04:54,730 --> 00:05:10,240
means that there is an operator,
Sz hat-- hat for operators.

69
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:21,230
And this operator, we
say, acts on this state

70
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,990
to give h-bar over
2 times this state.

71
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,660
So when we have a measurement
in quantum mechanics,

72
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,190
we end up talking
about operators.

73
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,880
So this case is no exception.

74
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,330
We think of the operator,
Sz, that acts in this state

75
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,390
and gives h-bar over 2.

76
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:53,870
And that same operator,
Sz, acts on the other state

77
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,960
and gives you minus h-bar
over 2 times the state.

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,020
You see, an operator on a
state must give a state.

79
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,470
So in this equation, we
have a state on the right,

80
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,890
and the nice thing is
that the same state

81
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,640
appears on the right.

82
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,220
When that happens,
you say that the state

83
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,140
is an eigenstate
of the operator.

84
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,250
And, therefore, the
states z plus, minus

85
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,620
are eigenstates of the
operator Sz with eigenvalues--

86
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:36,470
the number that appears here--
equal to plus, minus h over 2.

87
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,770
So the relevant
physical assumption

88
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:47,330
here is the following, that
these two states, in a sense,

89
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,790
suffice.

90
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,660
Now, what does that mean?

91
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:57,300
We could do the experiment again
with some Stern-Gerlach machine

92
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,640
that is along the
x-axis, and say, oh,

93
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,030
now we've got states
x plus and x minus

94
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,520
and we should add them there.

95
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,490
They are also part of the
possible states of the system.

96
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,220
Kind of.

97
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,400
They are parts of the
possible states of the system.

98
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,850
They are possible
states of the system,

99
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,550
but we shouldn't add
them to this one.

100
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,570
These will be thought
as basis states.

101
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,350
Just like any vector
is the superposition

102
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,840
of a number times
the x-unit vector

103
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,890
plus a number times
the y-unit vector

104
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,410
and a number times
the z-unit vector,

105
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,460
we are going to
postulate, or try

106
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,420
to construct the theory
of spin, based on the idea

107
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,730
that all possible spin
states of an electron

108
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:53,140
are obtained by suitable linear
superposition of these two

109
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,200
vectors.

110
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,760
So, , in fact, what we're
going to say is that these two

111
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,900
vectors are the basis of a
two-dimensional vector space,

112
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,890
such that every possible state
is a linear superposition.

113
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:23,400
So psi, being any
possible spin state,

114
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:35,725
can be written as some constant,
C1 times z plus plus C2 times z

115
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:43,940
minus where these
constants, C1 and C2 belong

116
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,210
to the complex numbers.

117
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,690
And by this, we mean that
if any possible state is

118
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:57,160
a superposition like that,
the set of all possible states

119
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:03,670
are the general vectors in a
two-dimensional complex vector

120
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,620
space.

121
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,650
Complex vector space, because
the coefficients are complex,

122
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:17,220
and two-dimensional, because
there's two basis vectors.

123
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,770
Now this doesn't quite
look like a vector.

124
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,190
It looks like those
things called kets.

125
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,830
But kets are really
vectors, and we're

126
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,160
going to make the
correspondence very clear.

127
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,680
So this can be called
the first basis

128
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:44,560
state and the
second basis state.

129
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,910
And I want you to realize
that the fact that we're

130
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,830
talking about the complex
vector space really

131
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,530
means these coefficients
are complex.

132
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:07,080
There's no claim that the
vector is complex in any sense,

133
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,300
or this one.

134
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,030
They're just vectors.

135
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,950
This is a vector, and
it's not that we say,

136
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,971
oh this vector is complex.

137
00:10:15,971 --> 00:10:16,470
No.

138
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,170
A complex vector space, we
think of as a set of vectors,

139
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,540
and then we're allowed
to multiply them

140
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,715
by complex numbers.

141
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:38,840
OK, so we have this, and this
way of thinking of the vectors

142
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,730
is quite all right.

143
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,230
But we want to be more concrete.

144
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,200
For that, we're
going to use what

145
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,800
is called a representation.

146
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,270
So I will use the
word representation

147
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:58,010
to mean some way of
exhibiting a vector

148
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,050
or state in a more concrete way.

149
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,160
As something that any one
of us would call a vector.

150
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:14,080
So as a matter of notation,
this being the first basis state

151
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,230
is sometimes written
as a ket with a 1.

152
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,370
Like that.

153
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,700
And this being this
second basis state

154
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,720
is sometimes written this way.

155
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,340
But here is the
real issue of what

156
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,890
we were calling
a representation.

157
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:38,580
If this is a two-dimensional
vector space,

158
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,820
you're accustomed to
three-dimensional vector space.

159
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,040
What are vectors?

160
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,380
They're triplets of numbers.

161
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,330
Three numbers.

162
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,110
That's a vector.

163
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,600
Column vectors, it's perhaps
easier to think about them.

164
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,990
So column vectors.

165
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,570
So here's what
we're going to say.

166
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,790
We have this state z plus.

167
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,720
It's also called 1.

168
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,000
It's just a name,
but we're going

169
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,200
to represent it as
a column vector.

170
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,060
And as a column
vector, I'm going

171
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,750
to represent it as the
column vector 1, 0.

172
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,160
And this is why I put
this double arrow.

173
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,540
I'm not saying it's
the same thing--

174
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,830
although the really
it is-- it's just

175
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:37,220
a way of thinking about it as
some vector in what we would

176
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,080
call canonically a vector space.

177
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,018
Yes

178
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:42,208
AUDIENCE: So do the components
of the column vector

179
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:45,940
there have any
correspondence to the actual.

180
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,750
Does it have any basis in the
actual physical process going

181
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,250
on?

182
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,780
Or, what is their connection to
the actual physical [INAUDIBLE]

183
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,860
represented here?

184
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,040
PROFESSOR: Well, we'll
see it in a second.

185
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,240
It will become a little clearer.

186
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,740
But this is like saying, I have
a two-dimensional two0 vector

187
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,770
space, so I'm going to think of
the first state as this vector.

188
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,490
But how do I write this vector?

189
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,110
Well, it's the vector ex.

190
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:15,260
Well, if I would write
them in components,

191
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,310
I would say, for a vector, I can
put two numbers here, a and b.

192
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,120
And this is the a-component
and b-component.

193
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,085
So here it is, ex would be 1, 0.

194
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:33,740
And ey would be 0, 1.

195
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,837
If I have this notation
then the point a,

196
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:41,500
b is represented by a
and b as a column vector.

197
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,580
So at this moment,
it's just a way

198
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,370
of associating a vector in
the two-dimensional canonical

199
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,320
vector space.

200
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,770
It's just the column here.

201
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:58,520
So the other state,
minus-- it's also

202
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,470
called 2-- will be
represented by 0 1 1.

203
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:12,840
1 And therefore,
this state, psi,

204
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:22,480
which is C1 z plus
plus C2 z minus

205
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:31,870
will be represented as C1 times
the first vector plus C2 times

206
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,800
the second vector.

207
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,220
Or multiplying, in C1, C2.

208
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:49,890
So this state can be written
as a linear superposition

209
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,590
of these two basis
vectors in this way--

210
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,720
you can write it this way.

211
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,500
You want to save
some writing, then

212
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,010
you can write them with 1 and 2.

213
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,432
But as a vector, it's
represented by a column vector

214
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:05,265
with two components.

215
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,865
That's our state.

216
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,650
Now in doing this,
I want to emphasize,

217
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,090
we're introducing the
physical assumption

218
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,720
that this will be enough to
describe all possible spin

219
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,020
states, which is far from
obvious at this stage.

220
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,230
Nevertheless, let's
use some of the ideas

221
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,020
from the experiment, the
Stern-Gerlach experiment.

222
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:44,590
We did one example of a box
that filtered the plus z states,

223
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,160
and then put it against
another z machine,

224
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,470
and then all the states
went through the up.

225
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:57,050
Which is to say that plus
states have no amplitude,

226
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,980
no probability to be
in the minus states.

227
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,980
They all went through the plus.

228
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,150
So when we're going to introduce
now the physical translation

229
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,620
of this fact, as saying
that these states are

230
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,890
orthogonal to each other.

231
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:19,950
So, this will require the
whole framework, in detail,

232
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,310
of bras and kets to
say really, precisely--

233
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,910
but we're going to do
that now and explain

234
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,580
the minimum necessary
for you to understand it.

235
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,840
But we'll come back to it later.

236
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,320
So this physical
statement will be

237
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,250
stated as z minus with z plus.

238
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:48,870
The overlap, the
bra-ket of this, is 0.

239
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:53,460
The fact that all particles
went through and went out

240
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:59,610
through the plus output
will state to us, well,

241
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,200
these states are
well normalized.

242
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:11,819
So z plus, z plus is 1

243
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,150
Similarly, you could have
blocked the other input,

244
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,965
and you would have
concluded that the minus

245
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:19,240
state is orthogonal to the plus.

246
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,839
So we also say that these,
too, are orthogonal,

247
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,020
and the minus states
are well normalized.

248
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,870
Now here we had to
write four equations.

249
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:45,460
And the notation, one
and two becomes handy,

250
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,620
because we can summarize
all these statements

251
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:56,840
by the equation Ij
equals delta Ij.

252
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:04,730
Look, if this equation
is 2 with 1 equals 0.

253
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,240
The bra 2, the ket 1.

254
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,220
This is 1 with 1 is equal to 1.

255
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:22,020
Here is is 1 with 2 is equal to
0, and 2 with 2 is equal to 1.

256
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,850
So this is exactly
what we have here.

257
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,340
Now, I didn't define for
you these so-called bras.

258
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,790
So by completeness, I
will define them now.

259
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:47,120
And the way I will define
them is as follows.

260
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:56,390
I will say that while for
the one vector basis state

261
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:04,460
you associate at 1, 0, you will
associate to one bra, the row

262
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,030
vector 1, 0.

263
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,590
I sometimes tend to
write equal, but-- equal

264
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,760
is all right-- but
it's a little clearer

265
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,470
to say that there's arrows here.

266
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:24,440
So we're going to associate to
1, 1, 0-- we did it before--

267
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,260
but now to the bra, we
think of the rho vector.

268
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,500
Like this.

269
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,220
Similarly, I can
do the same with 2.

270
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,670
2 was the vector 0, 1.

271
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:41,050
It's a column vector,
so 2 was a bra.

272
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:47,960
We will think of it as
the row vector 0, 1.

273
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:08,080
We're going to do this now
a little more generally.

274
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,990
So, suppose you
have state, alpha,

275
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:19,810
which is alpha 1,
1 plus alpha 2, 2.

276
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:26,100
Well, to this, you would
associate the column vector

277
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,500
alpha 1, alpha 2.

278
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:37,640
Suppose you have a beta state,
beta 1, 1 plus beta 2, 2.

279
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,360
You would associate beta 1,
beta 2 as their representations.

280
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,440
Now here comes the
definition for which

281
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,630
this is just a special case.

282
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,790
And it's a definition
of the general bra.

283
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:11,050
So the general bra here, alpha,
is defined to be alpha 1*,

284
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:19,770
bra of the first, plus
alpha 2*, bra of the second.

285
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:26,710
So this is alpha 1*
times the first bra,

286
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:35,400
which we think of it as 1, 0,
plus alpha 2* times the second

287
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,190
bra, which is 0, 1.

288
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,410
So this whole thing is
represented by alpha 1*,

289
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,890
alpha 2*.

290
00:21:51,600 --> 00:22:02,200
So, here we've had a column
vector representation

291
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,320
of a state, and the bra is
the row vector representation

292
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,120
of the state in which
this is constructed

293
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,670
with complex conjugation.

294
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:19,740
Now these kind of
definitions will

295
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,410
be discussed in more detail
and more axiomatically

296
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,800
early very soon, so that
you see where you're going.

297
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,860
But the intuition that
you're going to get from this

298
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,640
is quite valuable.

299
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,286
So what is the bra-ket?

300
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,090
Alpha-beta is the
so-called bra-ket.

301
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:42,130
And this is a number.

302
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,280
And the reason for
complex conjugation

303
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,250
is, ultimately, that when
these two things are the same,

304
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,270
it should give a
positive number.

305
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,880
It's like the length squared.

306
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,230
So that's the reason for
complex conjugation, eventually.

307
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:04,720
But, for now, you are supposed
to get a number from here.

308
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,160
And the a reasonable way
to get a number, which

309
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,620
is a definition, is
that you get a number

310
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,090
by a matrix multiplication
of the representatives.

311
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:22,800
So you take the representative
of alpha, which is alpha 1*,

312
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,140
alpha 2*.

313
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,480
And do the matrix product
with the representative

314
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,970
of beta, which is
beta 1, beta 2.

315
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:41,480
And that's alpha 1*, beta
1 plus alpha 2*, beta 2.

316
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,670
And that's the number
called the inner product,

317
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,760
or bra-ket product.

318
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:55,300
And this is the true meaning
of relations of this kind.

319
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,670
If you're given an
arbitrary states,

320
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:01,180
you compute the inner
product this way.

321
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:08,280
And vectors that satisfy
this are called orthonormal

322
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,770
because they're orthogonal
and normal with respect

323
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,490
to each other in the
sense of the bra and ket.

324
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:31,060
So this definition,
as you can see,

325
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,970
is also consistent with
what you have up there,

326
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,020
and you can check it.

327
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:43,380
If you take I with j, 1,
say, with 2-- like this--

328
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,290
you do the inner
product, and you get 0.

329
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:50,270
And similarly for
all the other states.

330
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:57,980
So let's then complete the
issue of representations.

331
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,600
We had representations
of the states

332
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,560
as column vectors-- two by two
column vectors or row vectors.

333
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,370
Now let's talk about this
operator we started with.

334
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:16,220
If this is an operator,
acting on states,

335
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,330
now I want to think of
its representation, which

336
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:24,310
would be the way it acts on
these two component vectors.

337
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:28,700
So it must be a two by two
matrix, because only a two

338
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,510
by two matrix acts naturally
on two component vectors.

339
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,970
So here is the
claim that we have.

340
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:46,920
Claim, that Sz hat
is represented--

341
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,973
but we'll just put
equal-- by this matrix.

342
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,790
You see, it was an operator.

343
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,790
We never talked about matrices.

344
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:10,570
But once we start talking about
the basis vectors as column

345
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,810
vectors, then you can
ask if this is correct.

346
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:18,470
So for example, I'm
supposed to find

347
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:23,980
that Sz hat acting
on this state 1

348
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,270
is supposed to be h-bar
over 2 times the state 1.

349
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:28,850
You see?

350
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,220
True.

351
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:35,060
Then you say, oh let's put the
representation, h-bar over 2,

352
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,280
1 minus 1, 0, 0.

353
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,980
State one, what's
its representation?

354
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,510
1, 0.

355
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,520
OK, let's act on it.

356
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,150
So, this gives me h-bar over 2.

357
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,850
I do the first
product, I get a 1.

358
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:56,220
I do the second
product, I get a 0.

359
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,970
Oh, that seems
right, because this

360
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:03,090
is h over 2 times the
representation of the state 1.

361
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:12,470
And if I check this,
and as well that Sz on 2

362
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:18,740
is equal minus h-bar over 2, 2--
which can also be checked-- I

363
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,070
need to check no more.

364
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:25,320
Because it suffices
that this operator does

365
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,020
what it's supposed to
do of the basis vectors.

366
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,690
And it will do
what it's supposed

367
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,260
to do on arbitrary vectors.

368
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,470
So we're done.

369
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:40,460
This is the operator
Sx, and we seem

370
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,390
to have put together a lot of
the ideas of the experiment

371
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,910
into a mathematical framework.

372
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:54,040
But we're not through because
we have this question,

373
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,380
so what if you align and
operate the machine along x?

374
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,055
What are the possible spin
states along the x-direction?

375
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,930
How do you know that
all that the spins state

376
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:09,370
that points along x can be
described in this vector space?

377
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:13,770
How do I know there
exists a number C1, C2 so

378
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,130
that this linear
combination is a spin

379
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:21,130
state that points along x.

380
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:28,430
Well, at this moment, you
really have to invent something.

381
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:35,020
And the process of invention
is never a very linear one.

382
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,780
You use analogies--
you use whatever

383
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,950
you can-- to invent
what you need.

384
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,940
So, given that
that's a possibility,

385
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,520
we could follow what Feynman
does in his Feynman lectures,

386
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,900
of discussing how
to begin rotating

387
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:56,080
Stern-Gerlach machines, and
doing all kinds of things.

388
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,040
It's an interesting argument,
and it's a little hard

389
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:07,240
to follow, a little
tedious at points.

390
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,940
And we're going to
follow a different route.

391
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,540
I'm going to assume that you
remember a little about angular

392
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:19,670
momentum, and I think you
do remember this much.

393
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:23,193
I want to say, well, this
is spin angular momentum.

394
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,780
Well, let's compare it with
orbital angular momentum,

395
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,130
and see where we are.

396
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:37,260
You see, another way of asking
the question would be, well,

397
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,970
what are the
operators Sx and Sy.

398
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,180
Where do I get them?

399
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:48,190
Well, the reason I want to
bring in the angular momentum

400
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:54,330
is because there you have Lz,
but you also have Lx and Ly.

401
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:59,590
So angular momentum had
Lz, just like we had here,

402
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:07,905
but also Lx and Ly.

403
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,920
Now these spin things look a
lot more mysterious, a lot more

404
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:27,650
basic, because, like Lz,
it was xpy minus ypx.

405
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:32,513
So you knew how this operator
acts on wave functions.

406
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,620
You know, it multiplies by
y, takes an x derivative,

407
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,460
or it's a dd phi.

408
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:48,130
It has a nice thing, but Sz on
the other hand, there's no x,

409
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,470
there's no derivatives.

410
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,810
It's a different space.

411
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,840
It's working in a
totally different space,

412
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,270
in the space of a
two-dimensional complex vector

413
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,170
space of column vectors
with two numbers.

414
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,860
That's where it acts.

415
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,900
I'm sorry there's no dd x,
nothing familiar about it.

416
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,920
But that's what we
have been handed.

417
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,910
So this thing acts
on wave functions,

418
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,400
and thus natural things.

419
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,410
Well, the other one
acts on column vectors.

420
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:23,160
Two-by-two-- two
component column vectors,

421
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,860
and that's all right.

422
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,540
But we also know
that Lz is Hermitian.

423
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,550
And that was good,
because it actually

424
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,950
meant that this is
good observable.

425
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,310
You can measure it.

426
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:39,340
Is Sz Hermitian?

427
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,170
Well, yes it is.

428
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,460
Hermeticity of a matrix--
as we'll discuss it

429
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,310
in a lot of detail, maybe
more than you want--

430
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:52,760
means you can transpose
it complex conjugated,

431
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,380
and you get the same matrix.

432
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,430
Well that matrix is Hermitian.

433
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,920
So that's nice.

434
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,260
That maybe is important.

435
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,740
So what other
operators do we have?

436
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,910
Lx and Ly.

437
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:18,550
And if we think of Lx as
L1, Ly as L2, and Lz as L3,

438
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:22,740
you had a basic
computation relation.

439
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:33,530
Li with Lj was equal to i
epsilon ijk Lk-hat-- oops

440
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,030
i-hbar.

441
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:41,780
And this was called the
algebra of angular momentum.

442
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:46,350
These three operators
satisfy these identities.

443
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:53,170
i and j are here, k is supposed
to be summed over-- repeated

444
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:56,690
in this is our sum
from 1, 2, and 3.

445
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,250
And epsilon ijk is totally
anti-symmetric with epsilon 1,

446
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,270
2, 3 equal to plus 1.

447
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:09,180
You may or may not
know this epsilon.

448
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:12,870
You will get some practice
on that very soon.

449
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,410
Now for all intents
and purposes,

450
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,200
we might as well write
the explicit formulas

451
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,880
between Lx, Ly equal i-hbar Lz.

452
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:32,700
Ly Lz equals i-hbar Lx.

453
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:42,765
And Lz Lx-- there are hats
all over-- equal i-hbar Ly.

454
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,970
So we had this for
orbital angular momentum,

455
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:00,630
or for angular
momentum in general.

456
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,420
So what we're going
to do now is we're

457
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:16,790
going to try to figure out
what are Sx and Sy by trying

458
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,550
to find a complete analogy.

459
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:24,570
We're going to declare that S
is going to be angular momentum.

460
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:36,900
So we're going to want that
Sx with Sy will be i-hbar Sz.

461
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:41,900
Sy with Sz will be i-hbar Sx.

462
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:52,775
And finally, Sz with
Sx is i-hbar Sy.

463
00:34:55,389 --> 00:35:01,820
And we're going to try that
these things be Hermitian.

464
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,700
Sx and Sy.

465
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:11,240
So let me break for a second
and ask if there are questions.

466
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,650
We're aiming to
complete the theory

467
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:21,460
by taking S to be angular
momentum, and see what we get.

468
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,650
Can we invent
operators Sx and Sy

469
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,160
that will do the right thing?

470
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,654
Yes.

471
00:35:27,654 --> 00:35:30,546
AUDIENCE: What's the
name for the epsilon ijk?

472
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:34,570
I know there's a special
name for the [INAUDIBLE].

473
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,836
PROFESSOR: What's the name?

474
00:35:35,836 --> 00:35:38,316
AUDIENCE: There's a
[INAUDIBLE] tensor.

475
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:40,280
PROFESSOR: That's right.

476
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,655
Let [INAUDIBLE]
to be the tensor.

477
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,145
It can be used for
cross products.

478
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:48,790
It's very useful
for cross products.

479
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,600
It's a really useful tensor.

480
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,030
Other questions.

481
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:55,060
More questions about
what we're going

482
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,230
to try to do, or this so far.

483
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,060
Yes.

484
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,590
AUDIENCE: When you use
the term representation,

485
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,884
is that like the technical
mathematical term

486
00:36:07,884 --> 00:36:10,046
of representation,
like in algebra?

487
00:36:10,046 --> 00:36:10,670
PROFESSOR: Yes.

488
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:15,210
It's representation of
operators in vector spaces.

489
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,900
So we've used the
canonical vector space

490
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:25,800
with column vectors represented
by entries one and numbers.

491
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,730
And then the operators
become matrices,

492
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:32,980
so whenever an operator
is viewed as a matrix,

493
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,845
we think of it as
a representation.

494
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:38,760
Other questions.

495
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,966
Yes.

496
00:36:39,966 --> 00:36:41,830
AUDIENCE: Will we
talk about later

497
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:46,020
why we can make an
analogy between L and S?

498
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,450
Or is it [INAUDIBLE]?

499
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:57,990
PROFESSOR: Well you see, this
is a very strong analogy,

500
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,800
but there will be
big differences

501
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,930
from orbital angular momentum
and spin angular momentum.

502
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:07,990
And basically having
to do with the fact

503
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,400
that the eigenvalues
of these operators

504
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,320
are plus minus h-bar over 2.

505
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,040
And in the orbital
case they tend

506
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,460
to be plus minus
integer values of h-bar.

507
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:24,535
So this is a very deep
statement about the algebra

508
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:28,840
of these operators that still
allows the physics of them

509
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,700
to be quite different.

510
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,820
But this is probably the only
algebra that makes sense.

511
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,160
It's angular momentum.

512
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,280
So we're going to try to
develop that algebra like that,

513
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,040
as well here.

514
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,180
You could take it
to be an assumption.

515
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:48,280
And as I said, an experiment
doesn't tell you the unique way

516
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,820
to invent the mathematics.

517
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,540
You try to invent the
consistent mathematics

518
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,530
and see if it coincides
with the experiment.

519
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:03,720
And this is a very natural
thing to try to invent

520
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,960
So what are we facing?

521
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,340
We're facing a slightly
nontrivial problem

522
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,010
of figuring out these operators.

523
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,250
And they should be Hermitian.

524
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:20,880
So let's try to think of
Hermitian two-by-two matrices.

525
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:34,620
So here is a Hermitian
two-by-two matrix.

526
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:38,850
I can put an arbitrary
constant here because it

527
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:43,580
should be invariant on
their transposition, which

528
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:47,170
doesn't change this diagonal
value in complex conjugation.

529
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,980
So c should be real.

530
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,335
d should be real.

531
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,050
For the matrix to be
Hermitian, two-by-two matrix,

532
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:04,300
I could put an a here.

533
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:09,500
And then this a would have
to appear here as well.

534
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:15,440
I can put minus ib, and then
I would have plus ib here.

535
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,310
So when I transpose a complex
conjugate, I get this one.

536
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:30,180
So this matrix with abc
and d real is Hermitian.

537
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,860
Hermiticity is some sort
of reality condition.

538
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:47,940
Now, for convenience, I
would put a 2c and a 2d here.

539
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,340
It doesn't change
things too much.

540
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,780
Now to look at what
we're talking about.

541
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,673
We're talking about this
set of Hermitian matrices.

542
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:10,210
Funnily, you can think of
that again as a vector space.

543
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,350
Why a vector space?

544
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,310
Well, we'll think about
it, and in a few seconds,

545
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,500
it will become clear.

546
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,830
But let me just try
to do something here

547
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:22,450
that might help us.

548
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,640
We're trying to identify
Sx and Sy from here

549
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,280
so that this commutation
relations hold.

550
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,840
Well, if Sx and Sy have anything
to do with the identity matrix,

551
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,510
they would commute
with everything

552
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:45,050
and would do nothing for you.

553
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:50,070
So, I will remove from
this matrices then trying

554
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:54,300
to understand something having
to do with the identity.

555
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,670
So I'll remove a
Hermitian matrix,

556
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:03,960
which is c plus d
times the identity--

557
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,500
the two-by-two identity matrix.

558
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,080
This is a Hermitian
matrix, as well.

559
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,670
And I can remove it, and then
this matrix is still Hermitian,

560
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:19,760
and this piece that I've removed
doesn't change commutators

561
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,410
as they appear on
the left hand side.

562
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:25,390
So if you have an
Sx and an xy here,

563
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,110
and you're trying
to do a computation,

564
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,510
it would not contribute,
so you might as well just

565
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,570
get rid of them.

566
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:36,460
So if we remove
this, we are left

567
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,250
with-- you're subtracting
c plus d from the diagonal.

568
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,920
So here you'll have c minus d.

569
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:54,520
Here you'll get b minus c,
a minus ib, and a plus ib.

570
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,810
And we should keep searching for
Sx and Sy among these matrices.

571
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:08,690
But then you say,
look, I already got Sz,

572
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,300
and that was Hermitian.

573
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,380
And Sz was Hermitian,
and it had a number,

574
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,920
and the opposite number on
the other diagonal entry.

575
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:27,380
If Sx and Sy have a little
bit of Sz, I don't care.

576
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,930
I don't want these to
be independent matrices.

577
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,740
I don't want to
confuse the situation.

578
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:39,980
So if this thing has something
along Sz, I want it out.

579
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:45,400
So since precisely this number
is opposite to this one,

580
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,270
I can add to this matrix
some multiple of Sz

581
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,890
and kill these things
in the diagonal.

582
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:06,760
So add the multiple
and Sz multiple,

583
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,140
and we finally get this matrix.

584
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:17,240
0, a minus ib, a plus ib, and 0.

585
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:25,680
So we've made quite
some progress.

586
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,450
Let's see now what we have.

587
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:45,870
Well, that matrix could be
written as a times 0, 1, 1,

588
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:54,050
0 plus b times 0, minus i, i, 0.

589
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,780
Which is to say that it's
this Hermitian matrix

590
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,640
times a real number, and
this Hermitian matrix

591
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,140
times a real number.

592
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:14,060
And that makes sense because
if you take a Hermitian matrix

593
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:18,610
and multiply by a real number,
the matrix is still Hermitian.

594
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:21,560
So this is still Hermitian
because these are real.

595
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,760
This is still Hermitian
because a is real,

596
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,520
and if you add Hermitian
matrices, it's still Hermitian.

597
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:35,320
So in some sense, the set
of Hermitian matrices,

598
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:41,630
two-by-two Hermitian matrices,
is a real vector space

599
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:44,970
with four basis vectors.

600
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:50,220
One basis vector is this,
another basis vector is this,

601
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:55,620
the third basis
vector is the Sz part,

602
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,399
and the fourth basis
vector is the identity

603
00:44:58,399 --> 00:44:59,190
that we subtracted.

604
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:09,090
And I'm listing the
other two that we got rid

605
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:11,990
of because physically
we're not that interested

606
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:15,660
given that we want Sx and Sz.

607
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:18,370
So, Sx and Sy.

608
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:19,800
But here it is.

609
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,280
These four two-by-two
matrices are

610
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,795
sort of the linearly
independent Hermitian matrices.

611
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:36,060
You can think of them as
vectors, four basis vectors.

612
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,380
You multiply by real numbers,
and now you add them,

613
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:43,030
and you got the most
general Hermitian matrix.

614
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:48,870
So this is part of the subtlety
of this whole idea of vector

615
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,500
spaces of matrices,
which can be thought

616
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,920
of as vectors
sometimes, as well.

617
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,880
So that's why these
matrices are quite famous.

618
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,070
But before we just discuss
why they are so famous,

619
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,040
let's think of this.

620
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,890
Where we're looking
for Sx and Sy,

621
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:12,950
and we actually seem to
have two matrices here

622
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:19,660
that could do the job, as
two independent Hermitian

623
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,830
two-by-two matrices.

624
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:28,290
But we must add a little
extra information.

625
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,390
We don't know what the scale is.

626
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:36,270
Should I multiply this
by 5 and call that Sx?

627
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,830
Or this by 3?

628
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:41,240
We're missing a
little more physics.

629
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,660
What is the physics?

630
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:49,240
The eigenvalues of Sx should
also be plus minus h over 2.

631
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:54,240
And the eigenvalues of Sy should
also be plus minus h over 2.

632
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,120
Just like for Sz.

633
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,300
you could have started the
whole Stern-Gerlach things

634
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,810
thinking of x,
and you would have

635
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:04,020
obtained plus minus h over 2.

636
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,110
So that is the
physical constraint.

637
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:10,990
I have to figure
out those numbers.

638
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:15,730
Maybe Sx is this one,
as y is this one.

639
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:18,300
And you can say, oh,
you never told us

640
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,640
if you're going to get
the unique answer here.

641
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,080
And yes, I did tell
you, and you're not

642
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,110
going to get a unique answer.

643
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,820
There are some sign notations
and some other things,

644
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:32,020
but any answer is
perfectly good.

645
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,054
So once you get an answer,
it's perfectly good.

646
00:47:35,054 --> 00:47:36,720
Of course, we're going
to get the answer

647
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,640
that everybody likes.

648
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,520
And the convention is that
happily that everybody

649
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,920
uses this same convention.

650
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,891
Questions.

651
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:46,516
AUDIENCE: So I have
a related question,

652
00:47:46,516 --> 00:47:50,200
because at the beginning we
could have chosen the top right

653
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,880
entry to be a plus ib and the
bottom left to be a minus ib

654
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,980
and that would have yielded
a different basis matrix.

655
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,206
PROFESSOR: Right, I would have
called this plus and minus.

656
00:48:00,206 --> 00:48:00,706
Yes.

657
00:48:00,706 --> 00:48:04,110
AUDIENCE: Are we going to show
that this is the correct form?

658
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:06,210
PROFESSOR: No, it's
not the correct form.

659
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:11,110
It is a correct form, and it's
equivalent to any other form

660
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:12,540
you could find.

661
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,360
That's what we can show.

662
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,590
In fact, I will
show that there's

663
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:19,990
an obvious ambiguity here.

664
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:23,080
Well, in fact, maybe I can
tell it do you, I think.

665
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:36,260
If you let Sx go to minus
Sy, and Sy goes to plus Sx,

666
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,340
nothing changes in
these equations.

667
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,870
They become the same equations.

668
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,350
You know, Sx would
become minus Sy,

669
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,940
and this Sx-- this
is not changed.

670
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,870
But, in fact, if you
put minus Sy and Sx

671
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:53,330
as the same commutator
then this one

672
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,180
will become actually
this commutator,

673
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,700
and this one will become that.

674
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,230
So I could change
whatever I get for Sx,

675
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:02,765
change it from minus
Sy, for example,

676
00:49:02,765 --> 00:49:05,240
and get the same thing.

677
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,460
So there are many
changes you can do.

678
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,770
The only thing we need
is one answer that works.

679
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:13,520
And I'm going to write,
of course, the one

680
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,980
that everybody likes.

681
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:17,630
But don't worry about that.

682
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:21,550
So let's think of eigenvectors
and eigenvalues now.

683
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:24,850
I don't know how much
you remember that,

684
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:29,000
but we'll just take it at
this moment that you do.

685
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,910
So 0, 1, 1, 0 has
two eigenvalues,

686
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:39,950
and lambda equals 1,
with eigenvector 1

687
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:42,265
over square root of 2, 1, 1.

688
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,420
And a lambda equals minus
1 with eigenvector 1

689
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,075
over square root
of 2, 1, minus 1.

690
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:17,000
The other one, it's
equally easy to do.

691
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,970
We'll discuss eigenvectors
and eigenvalues later.

692
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:30,490
Minus i, i, 0, 0, plus a
lambda equals one eigenvector,

693
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:36,000
with components 1 over
square root of 2, 1, and i.

694
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,860
I'm pretty sure it's 1 and i.

695
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:43,690
Yes, and a lambda
equals minus 1,

696
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:49,320
with components 1 over
square root 2, 1, minus i.

697
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,820
Now I put the 1 over
square root of 2

698
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,250
because I wanted them
to be normalized.

699
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:58,540
Remember how you're supposed
to normalize these things.

700
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:02,485
You're supposed to take the
row vector, complex conjugate,

701
00:51:02,485 --> 00:51:03,880
and multiply.

702
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,320
Well, you would get
1 for the length

703
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:10,680
of this, 1 for the
length of this.

704
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,630
You would get one for
the length of this,

705
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:15,130
but remember, you have
to complex conjugate,

706
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:17,860
otherwise you'll get 0.

707
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,270
Also, you will get one
for the length of this.

708
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:25,070
So these are our eigenvalues.

709
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:29,930
So actually, with eigenvalues
lambda equals 1 and minus 1

710
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:32,910
for these two, we're
in pretty good shape.

711
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:43,020
We could try Sx to be h-bar
over 2 times 0, 1, 1, 0.

712
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:55,310
And Sy to be h-bar over
2, 0, minus i, i, 0.

713
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:58,140
These would have the
right eigenvalues

714
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,930
because if you multiply
a matrix by a number,

715
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:03,430
the eigenvalue gets
multiplied by this number,

716
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:10,140
so the plus minus 1s become
plus minus h-bar over 2.

717
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:13,480
But what are we was
supposed to check?

718
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,218
If this is to work,
we're supposed

719
00:52:15,218 --> 00:52:16,343
to check these commutators.

720
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:23,060
So let's do one, at least.

721
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:27,480
Sx commutator with Sy.

722
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:33,580
So what do we get? h-bar over
2, h-bar over 2-- two of them--

723
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:40,150
then the first matrix, 0,
1, 1, 0 times 0, minus i, i,

724
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:48,980
0, minus 0, minus i,
i, 0 times 0, 1, 1, 0.

725
00:52:48,980 --> 00:53:03,720
Which is h-bar over 2 times
h-bar over 2, times i, 0, 0,

726
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:13,860
minus i, minus minus i, 0, 0, i.

727
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:21,805
And we're almost there.

728
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:36,190
What do we have?

729
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:40,630
Well, we have h-bar
over 2, h-bar over 2.

730
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:44,150
And we've got 2i and minus 2i.

731
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:58,710
So this is h-bar over 2 times
h-bar over 2, times 2i times 1,

732
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:01,360
minus 1.

733
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:07,610
And this whole thing is i
h-bar, and the other part

734
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:14,410
is h-bar over 2, 1, minus 1,
which is i h-bar as z-hat.

735
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,440
Good, it works.

736
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,080
You know, the only
thing that could

737
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,240
have gone wrong-- you could
have identified 1 with a minus,

738
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,540
or something like that It
would have been equally good.

739
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:36,310
Once you have these
operators, we're fine.

740
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:41,170
So one has to check that the
other ones work, and they do.

741
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:44,540
I will leave them
for you to check.

742
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:49,820
And therefore, we've
got the three matrices.

743
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:55,360
It's a very important
result-- the Sx Sy, and Sz.

744
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:04,130
I will not rewrite them, but
they should be boxed nicely,

745
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:07,900
the three of them
together, with that

746
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,015
one there on top
of the blackboard.

747
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:17,270
And of course by construction,
they're Hermitian.

748
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,490
They're famous
enough that people

749
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:22,090
have defined the
following object.

750
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:27,680
Si is defined to
be h-bar over 2,

751
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,050
sigma i, the power
of the matrix sigmas.

752
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:38,310
And these are poly matrices,
sigma one is 0, 1, 1, 0.

753
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:43,140
Sigma two is 0, minus i, i, 0.

754
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:48,340
And sigma three is equal
to 1, minus 1, 0, 0.

755
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:58,820
OK, so in principle--
yes, question.

756
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,236
AUDIENCE: Is it
at all significant

757
00:56:00,236 --> 00:56:05,980
that the poly matrices are
all squared [INAUDIBLE]?

758
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,100
PROFESSOR: Yes,
it is significant.

759
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:13,300
We'll use it, but at this
moment, it's not urgent for us.

760
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:20,686
We'll have no application
of that property

761
00:56:20,686 --> 00:56:22,690
for a little while,
but it will help

762
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:27,508
us do a lot of the algebra
of the poly matrices.

763
00:56:27,508 --> 00:56:30,980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
eigenvalues, right?

764
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:31,972
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

765
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:35,940
AUDIENCE: Doesn't that follow
from the eigenvalue properties

766
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:40,256
that we've [INAUDIBLE]
plus or minus one.

767
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:46,910
Because those were both
squared. [INAUDIBLE].

768
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,390
PROFESSOR: That's right.

769
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:54,340
I think so.

770
00:56:54,340 --> 00:57:05,110
Our eigenvalues--
yes, it's true.

771
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:09,100
That the fact that the
eigenvalues are plus minus 1

772
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:13,390
will imply that these
matrices squared themselves.

773
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:17,280
So it's incorporated
into our analysis.

774
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,210
The thing that I will say
is that you don't need it

775
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,680
in the expression
of the commutators.

776
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,470
So in the
commentators, it didn't

777
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:28,480
play a role to begin with.

778
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,800
Put it as an extra condition.

779
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,990
Now what is the next thing
we really want to understand?

780
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:39,540
Is that in terms
of plain states,

781
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:44,940
we now have the answer for most
of the experiments we could do.

782
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:48,520
So in particular,
remember that we

783
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:53,560
said that we would have Sx,
for example, having states

784
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:59,880
x plus minus, which
are h-bar over 2

785
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:05,930
plus minus, x comma plus minus.

786
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:11,660
The states along the
x-direction referred

787
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:16,010
like that would be the
eigenstates of the Sx operator.

788
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:20,370
But we've calculated the
states of the Sx operator--

789
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:23,040
they're here.

790
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:27,180
The Sx operator is h-bar
over 2 times this matrix.

791
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,200
And we have those things.

792
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,606
So the plus eigenvalue
and the minus eigenvalue

793
00:58:33,606 --> 00:58:36,170
will just show up here.

794
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:44,780
So let me write them, and
explain, in plain language,

795
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:47,490
what these states are.

796
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:53,630
So the eigenstate
with lambda equal

797
00:58:53,630 --> 00:59:00,720
1-- that would correspond
to h-bar over two-- so the x

798
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,890
plus corresponds to this vector.

799
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:10,070
So what is that state?

800
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:15,980
It's that vector which, if
you want more explicitly,

801
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:24,070
it's the z plus, plus z minus.

802
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:30,080
This is the state 1 over
square root of 2, 1, 1.

803
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:39,423
The x minus is z
plus, minus z minus.

804
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:47,800
As you see on that
blackboard, it's 1 minus 1.

805
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,150
So here it is.

806
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:55,010
The states that you were looking
for, that are aligned along x--

807
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:57,860
plus x or minus x--
are not new states

808
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,340
that have you to add
to the state space.

809
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:05,160
They are linear combinations
of the states you've got.

810
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:14,070
We can invert this formula
and write, for example,

811
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:22,445
that z plus is 1 over
square root of 2, x plus,

812
01:00:22,445 --> 01:00:29,470
plus 1 over square
root of 2, x minus.

813
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:39,330
And z minus is 1 over square
root of 2, x plus, minus 1

814
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:43,130
over square root of--
minus the square root of 2

815
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:49,740
is already out, I'm
sorry-- minus x minus.

816
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:58,170
So actually, this answers
the question that you had.

817
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:02,170
For example, you
put a z plus state,

818
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:07,250
and you put an x
filter-- what amplitude

819
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:17,060
do you have to find a state
in the x plus, given that you

820
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:20,240
start with a state
on the z plus?

821
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:28,030
Well, you put an
x plus from here.

822
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:31,560
You get 1 from this
and 0 from this one

823
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,360
because the states
are always orthogonal.

824
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,860
The states are orthogonal--
you should check that.

825
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:41,270
And therefore, this is
1 over square root of 2.

826
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:47,200
If you ask for x minus
with respect to z plus,

827
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,100
that's also 1 over
square root of 2.

828
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,430
And these are the
amplitudes for this state

829
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:56,040
to be found in this, for this
state to be found in them.

830
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:56,890
They're equal.

831
01:01:56,890 --> 01:01:59,610
The probabilities are 1/2.

832
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:01,180
And that's good.

833
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,570
Our whole theory
of angular momentum

834
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:06,460
has given us something
that is perfectly

835
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:10,040
consistent with the
Stern-Gerlach experiment,

836
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:14,440
and it gives you
these probabilities.

837
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,695
You can construct in the
same way the y states.

838
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:26,980
So the y states
are the eigenstates

839
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:31,845
of that second matrix, Sy,
that we wrote on the left.

840
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:45,500
So this matrix is Sy, so
its eigenstates-- I'm sorry,

841
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,430
Sy is there.

842
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,060
Sy is there.

843
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:52,850
The eigenstates are
those, so immediately

844
01:02:52,850 --> 01:03:00,390
you translate that to say
that Sy has eigenstates y

845
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:03,770
plus minus, whose
eigenvalues are

846
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:08,880
plus minus h-bar
over 2y plus minus.

847
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:16,790
And y plus is equal 1
over square root of 2,

848
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:29,150
z plus-- and look at the first
eigenvector-- plus iz minus.

849
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:33,650
And, in fact, they can
put one formula for both.

850
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:34,640
Here they are.

851
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:43,600
So, it's kind of neat
that the x1s were

852
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,580
found by linear combinations,
and they're orthogonal.

853
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,100
Now, if you didn't
have complex numbers,

854
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:53,130
you could not form
another linear combination

855
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:55,300
of this orthogonal.

856
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,100
But thanks to these
complex numbers,

857
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:00,880
you can put an i there--
there's no i in the x ones--

858
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,430
and the states are
orthogonal, something

859
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:06,850
that you should check.

860
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:09,170
So again, you can
invert and find

861
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:11,550
the z states in
terms of y, and you

862
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:14,860
would conclude that the
amplitudes are really

863
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:18,060
the same up to signs, or
maybe complex numbers,

864
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:22,360
but the probabilities
are identical.

865
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,990
So we've gotten a long way.

866
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:28,650
We basically have
a theory that seems

867
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:33,460
to describe the whole result of
the Stern-Gerlach experiment,

868
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:37,690
but now your theory
can do more for you.

869
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:39,600
Now, in the last
few minutes, we're

870
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,550
going to calculate
the states that

871
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:44,960
are along arbitrary directions.

872
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:52,410
So here I produced a
state that is along

873
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:57,180
the x-direction plus, and
along the x-direction minus.

874
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:02,020
What I would like to construct,
to finish this story,

875
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:06,150
is a state that is along
some arbitrary direction.

876
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:16,010
So the state that points
along some unit vector n.

877
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:22,560
So here is space, and here's a
unit vector n with components

878
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:26,700
nx, , ny, and nz.

879
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:39,775
Or you can write the vector n
as nx ex plus ny ey plus nz ez.

880
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:45,660
And I would like
to understand how

881
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:49,710
I can construct, in
general, a spin state that

882
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:53,110
could be said to be
in the n direction.

883
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:56,610
We have the ones
along the z, x, and y,

884
01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:00,560
but let's try to get something
more general, the most general

885
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:03,490
one.

886
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:09,740
So for this, we
think of the triplet

887
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:17,350
of operators S, which
would be Sx, Sy, and Sz.

888
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:27,020
Now you can, if you wish,
write this as Sx-hat ex vector,

889
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:33,635
plus Sy-hat ey vector,
plus Sz hat ez vector.

890
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,580
But this object, if
you write it like that,

891
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:43,350
is really a strange object.

892
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:44,150
Think of it.

893
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:49,430
It's matrices, or operators,
multiplied by unit vectors.

894
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:52,790
These vectors have nothing
to do with the space

895
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:56,210
in which the matrices act.

896
01:06:56,210 --> 01:07:00,430
The matrices act in an abstract,
two-dimensional vector space,

897
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:04,540
while these vectors are sort
of for accounting purposes.

898
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:06,430
That's why we sometimes
don't write them,

899
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:09,300
and say we have a triplet.

900
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:12,850
So this product
means almost nothing.

901
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:14,260
They're just sitting together.

902
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:18,660
You could put the e to the
left of the x or to the right.

903
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:19,560
It's a vector.

904
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:23,130
You're not supposed to put
the vector inside the matrix,

905
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:24,480
either.

906
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,930
They don't talk to each.

907
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:29,650
It's an accounting procedure.

908
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:33,680
It is useful sometimes; we will
use it to derive identities

909
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,110
soon, but it's an
accounting procedure.

910
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:39,670
So here's what I want to define.

911
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:45,000
So this is a crazy thing, some
sort of vector valued operator,

912
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,110
or something like that.

913
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:48,450
But what we really
need is what we'll

914
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:57,430
call S-hat n, which will be
defined as n dot S. Where

915
01:07:57,430 --> 01:08:01,750
we take naively what a dot
product is supposed to mean.

916
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:04,160
This component times
this component,

917
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,560
which happens to be an operator.

918
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,950
This times this,
this times that.

919
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:18,100
nx Sx plus ny Sy, plus nz Sz.

920
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:20,830
And this thing is
something very intuitive.

921
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,800
It is just an operator.

922
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,850
It doesn't have anymore
a vector with it.

923
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:29,484
So it's a single operator.

924
01:08:29,484 --> 01:08:33,170
If your vector points
in the z-direction,

925
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:37,734
nx and ny z, and you have Sz
because it's a unit vector.

926
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:46,859
If the vector points in the
x-direction, you get Sx.

927
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:51,960
If the vector points in the
y-direction, you get Sy.

928
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:56,149
In general, this we
call the spin operator

929
01:08:56,149 --> 01:09:00,180
in the direction
of the vector n--

930
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:10,220
spin operator in
the direction of n.

931
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:19,540
OK, so what about
that spin operator?

932
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:25,779
Well, it had eigenvalues plus
minus h-bar over 2 along z, x,

933
01:09:25,779 --> 01:09:29,880
and y-- probably does still
have those eigenvalues--

934
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:34,630
but we have to make
this a little clearer.

935
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:40,450
So for that we'll
take nx and ny and nz

936
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:43,050
to be the polar
coordinate things.

937
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:49,229
So this vector is going
to have a theta here

938
01:09:49,229 --> 01:09:52,510
on the azimuthal
angle phi over here.

939
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:59,550
So nz is cosine theta.

940
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:02,575
nx and ny have sine theta.

941
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:09,370
And nx cosine phi, and
this one has sine phi.

942
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:19,940
So what is the
operator Sn vector hat?

943
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:26,080
Well, it's nx times Sx.

944
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:29,450
So, I'll put a h-bar
over 2 in front,

945
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:39,590
so we'll have nx sigma x,
or sigma1, plus ny sigma2, ,

946
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:42,510
plus nz sigma3.

947
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:47,460
Remember the spin operators
are proportional h-bar

948
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:53,480
over 2 times the sigmas--
so sigma1, sigma2, sigma3.

949
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:58,590
And look what we
get. h-bar over 2.

950
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:04,160
Sigma1 has an nx here, nx.

951
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:10,100
Sigma2 has minus iny plus iny.

952
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:14,260
And sigma3, we
have a nz minus nz.

953
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:27,612
So this is h-bar over 2, nz is
cosine theta, nx minus iny--

954
01:11:27,612 --> 01:11:30,130
you'd say, oh it's a
pretty awful thing,

955
01:11:30,130 --> 01:11:37,760
but it's very simple-- nx
minus iny is sine theta times e

956
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,630
to the minus i phi.

957
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:51,310
Here it would be sine
theta, e to the i phi,

958
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:53,786
and here we'll have
minus cosine theta.

959
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:00,760
So this is the whole
matrix, Sn-hat, like that.

960
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:06,580
Well, in the last
couple of minutes,

961
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:10,985
let's calculate the
eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

962
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:17,350
So what do we get?

963
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:19,410
Well, for the
eigenvalues, remember

964
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:23,980
what is the computation of
an eigenvalue of a matrix.

965
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:27,710
An eigenvalue for
matrix a, you write

966
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:34,325
that by solving the determinant
of a minus lambda 1 equals 0.

967
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:40,800
So for any matrix a,
if we want to find

968
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,330
the eigenvalues
of this matrix, we

969
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:49,760
would have to write
eigenvalues of Sn-hat.

970
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,840
We have to ride the
determinant of this,

971
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:04,190
minus lambda i, so the
determinant of h-bar over 2

972
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:09,770
cosine theta, minus lambda,
minus h-bar over 2 cosine

973
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:12,220
theta, minus lambda.

974
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:22,420
And here, it's sine theta, e
to the minus i phi, sine theta

975
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:29,630
e to the i phi, the
determinant of this being 0.

976
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:32,560
It's not as bad as it looks.

977
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,750
It's actually pretty simple.

978
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:38,550
These are a plus b, a minus b.

979
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:42,100
Here the phases cancel out.

980
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:49,630
The algebra you can read in the
notes, but you do get lambda

981
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:54,840
equals plus minus h-bar over 2.

982
01:13:54,840 --> 01:14:02,750
Now that is fine, and we
now want the eigenvectors.

983
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:08,450
Those are more non-trivial, so
they need a little more work.

984
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:11,860
So what are you supposed to
do to find an eigenvector?

985
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:17,760
You're supposed to take this
a minus lambda i, acting

986
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,310
on a vector, and put
it equal to zero.

987
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:21,435
And that's the eigenvector.

988
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:28,440
So, for this case,
we're going to try

989
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:34,600
to find the eigenvector n plus.

990
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:44,410
So this is the one that has
Sn on this state-- well,

991
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:51,485
I'll write it here, plus minus
h over 2, n plus minus here.

992
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:57,210
So let's try to find
this one that corresponds

993
01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:03,675
to the eigenvalue equal
to plus h-bar over 2.

994
01:15:03,675 --> 01:15:17,890
Now this state is C1 times z
plus, plus C2 times z minus.

995
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:21,420
These are our basis states,
so it's a little combination.

996
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:24,970
Or it's C1, C2.

997
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:26,790
Think of it as a matrix.

998
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:32,610
So we want the eigenvalues
of that-- the eigenvector

999
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:36,450
for that-- so what do we have?

1000
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:47,100
Well, we would have Sn-hat
minus h-bar over 2 times 1,

1001
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:55,560
on this C1, C2 equals 0.

1002
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,680
The eigenvector equation
is that this operator

1003
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:03,280
minus the eigenvalue
must give you that.

1004
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:07,730
So the h-bars over
2, happily, go out,

1005
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:10,930
and you don't really need
to worry about them anymore.

1006
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:19,700
And you get here cosine
theta minus 1, sine theta

1007
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:27,000
e to the minus i phi,
sine theta e to the i phi,

1008
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:36,720
and minus cosine theta
minus 1, C1, C2 equals 0.

1009
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:44,205
All right, so you
have two equations,

1010
01:16:44,205 --> 01:16:47,220
and both relate C1 and C2.

1011
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:51,050
Happily, and the reason
this works is because

1012
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:57,120
with this eigenvalue that
we've used that appears here,

1013
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,220
these two equations
are the same.

1014
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:01,100
So you can take
either one, and they

1015
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:05,900
must imply the same
relation between C1 and C2.

1016
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,490
Something you can check.

1017
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:11,840
So let me write one of them.

1018
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:19,090
C2 is equal to e to the i
phi, 1 minus cosine theta

1019
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:21,990
over sine theta C1.

1020
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:42,070
It's from the first line.

1021
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:49,560
So you have to remember, in
order to simplify these things,

1022
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,950
your half angle identities.

1023
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:52,450
Sorry.

1024
01:17:55,160 --> 01:18:00,930
1 minus cosine theta is 2
sine squared theta over 2,

1025
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:06,000
and sine theta is 2 sine theta
over 2 cosine theta over 2.

1026
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:15,540
So this becomes e to the
i phi sine theta over 2,

1027
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:19,040
over cosine theta over 2, C1.

1028
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,560
Now we want these things
to be well normalized,

1029
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:32,620
so we want C1 squared plus
C2 squared equal to 1.

1030
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:37,620
So, you know what C2
is, so this gives you

1031
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:43,430
C1 squared times 1 plus--
and C2 you use this,

1032
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:46,670
when you square the
phase goes away--

1033
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:54,100
sine squared theta over
2, cosine squared over 2

1034
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,940
must be equal to 1.

1035
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:59,930
Well, the numerator
is 1, so you learn

1036
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:08,250
that C1 squared is equal to
cosine squared theta over 2.

1037
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:10,370
Now you have to take
the square root,

1038
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:15,220
and you could put an i
or a phase or something.

1039
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,800
But look, whatever
phase you choose,

1040
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:22,200
you could choose C1 to
be cosine theta over 2,

1041
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,060
and say, I'm done.

1042
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,370
I want this one.

1043
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:28,810
Somebody would say, no
let's put the phase, e

1044
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:32,140
so to the i pi over 5.

1045
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:37,870
So that doesn't look good,
but four or even worse,

1046
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:41,100
this phase will show
up in C2 because C2

1047
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,870
is proportional to C1.

1048
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:45,090
So I can get rid of it.

1049
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:48,110
I only should put it
if I really need it,

1050
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:51,660
and I don't think I need
it, so I won't put it.

1051
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:53,330
And you can always
change your mind

1052
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:57,150
later-- nobody's going to
take your word for this.

1053
01:19:57,150 --> 01:20:02,180
So, in this case, C2 would
be sine theta over 2,

1054
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:05,850
e to the i phi.

1055
01:20:05,850 --> 01:20:08,000
It's nice, but it's [INAUDIBLE].

1056
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,965
And therefore, we got
this state n plus,

1057
01:20:11,965 --> 01:20:19,420
which is supposed to be
cosine theta over 2, z plus,

1058
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:30,060
and plus sine theta over
2, e to the i phi, z minus.

1059
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,365
This is a great result.

1060
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:38,700
It gives the
arbitrarily located spin

1061
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:42,480
state that point
in the n-direction.

1062
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:46,030
As a linear superposition
of your two basis states,

1063
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:49,240
it answers conclusively
the question

1064
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:52,350
that any spin state
in your system

1065
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:56,860
can be represented in this
two-dimensional vector space.

1066
01:20:56,860 --> 01:21:05,030
Now moreover, if I take
that theta equals 0,

1067
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:09,440
I have the z-axis, and it's
independent of the angle phi.

1068
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,850
The phi angle becomes
singular at the North Pole,

1069
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:14,160
but that's all right.

1070
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:18,340
When theta is equal to
0, this term is 0 anyway.

1071
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:21,300
And therefore, this goes,
and when theta is equal to 0,

1072
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:24,620
you recover the plus state.

1073
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:27,495
Now you can calculate
the minus state.

1074
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:35,610
And if you follow exactly the
same economical procedure,

1075
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:38,930
you will get the
following answer.

1076
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:41,520
And I think, unless
you've done a lot

1077
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,280
of eigenvalue calculations,
this is a calculation

1078
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:47,390
you should just redo.

1079
01:21:47,390 --> 01:21:50,300
So the thing that you get,
without thinking much,

1080
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:58,940
is that n minus is equal to
sine theta over 2 plus, minus

1081
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:06,230
cosine theta over 2,
e to the i phi minus.

1082
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:09,980
At least some way of solving
this equation gives you that.

1083
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:12,970
You could say, this is
natural, and this is fine.

1084
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:17,730
But that is not
so nice, actually.

1085
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:38,870
Take theta equal to
pi-- no, I'm sorry.

1086
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:43,470
Again, you take
theta equal to 0.

1087
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:45,570
Theta equal to 0--
this is supposed

1088
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:49,050
to be the minus state
along the direction.

1089
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:51,650
So this is supposed to
give you the minus state.

1090
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:56,030
Because the vector n is
along up, in the z-direction,

1091
01:22:56,030 --> 01:22:58,050
but you're looking at
the minus component.

1092
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:00,300
So theta equals 0.

1093
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:03,600
Sure, there's no plus,
but theta equals 0,

1094
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,340
and you get the minus state.

1095
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:11,850
And this is 1, and phi is
ill-defined-- it's not so nice,

1096
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:14,790
therefore-- so, at
this moment, it's

1097
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:20,600
convenient to multiply this
state by e to the minus i phi,

1098
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,240
times minus 1.

1099
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:27,830
Just multiply it by
that, so that n minus

1100
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:34,490
is equal to minus sine theta
over 2, e to the minus i phi,

1101
01:23:34,490 --> 01:23:42,680
plus, plus cosine
theta over 2, minus.

1102
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,785
And that's a nice
definition of the state.

1103
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:53,130
When theta is equal
to 0, you're fine,

1104
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:57,510
and it's more naturally
equivalent to what you know.

1105
01:23:57,510 --> 01:24:01,770
Theta equal to 0 gives you
the minus state, or z minus.

1106
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:04,770
I didn't put the zs
here, for laziness.

1107
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:08,510
And for theta equal to
0, the way the phase phi

1108
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:09,460
doesn't matter.

1109
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:10,960
So it's a little nicer.

1110
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:15,430
You could work with this
one, but you might this well

1111
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:16,520
leave it like that.

1112
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:22,000
So we have our general states,
we've done everything here

1113
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,450
that required some linear
algebra without doing

1114
01:24:26,450 --> 01:24:28,560
a review of linear
algebra, but that's

1115
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,800
what we'll start
to do next time.
